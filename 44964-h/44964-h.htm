<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>In all history of this American Republic, or
perhaps any other nation, there was no conflict
that was so terrible as our Civil war. Napoleon's
efforts to bring into reality his dream of
universal empire would not compare with it.</p>

<p>I have endeavored in this book to describe in
detail the chief points that were enacted on the
most important battlefields of that War. As
those who participated in that War are now fast
passing away, and the time will soon be here
when they will only be remembered by their
deeds of valor on these battlefields, I deem it
only fit and proper that those in all walks of
life should know more of these battles in detail
and of those who participated in them. I think
you will get this information from this book, as
it is written specially with this view. It should
specially appeal to teachers and students who
can use it in a supplementary way in connection
with the study of history of this period.</p>

<p>I now commend this book to you, and trust
that it may be the means of giving you more
light on this the greatest civil war of all time,
and that it may help to lengthen in the minds
of the American people their remembrance of
those who participated in it.</p>

<h2><a name="FIRST_BATTLE_OF_BULL_RUN" id="FIRST_BATTLE_OF_BULL_RUN">FIRST BATTLE OF BULL RUN</a></h2>

<p>At the beginning of July, 1861, the Federals
had 30,000 men encamped along the Potomac
near the heights of Arlington under the general
command of General Winfield Scott, who was
a veteran of the war of 1812, as well as the
Mexican war, but who was at this time aged and
infirm, and remained in Washington, and Brigadier-General
Irvin McDowell was in immediate
command of the army. Another 20,000 men lay
at Martinsburg under General Patterson who
like Scott was a veteran of the war of 1812 and
of the Mexican war.</p>

<p>At Manassas Junction, about thirty miles from
Washington, lay the Confederate army under
Brigadier-General Beauregard. General Joseph
E. Johnston was in command of 9,000 men in
the Shenandoah Valley. Johnston and Beauregard,
as well as McDowell, had with Scott and
Patterson battled at the gates of Mexico.</p>

<p>General Scott gave orders to McDowell to move
against Beauregard and on the 16th day of July
the army, with waving banners and lively hopes
of victory, and with "On to Richmond" as their
battle cry, moved on Manassas. General McDowell
brought his army to a halt at Centreville
within seven miles of Manassas. Beauregard
was apprised of the coming of the Federals. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
stream of Bull Run, from which the first great
battle of the war derived its name, flowed between
the two armies. Patterson failed to detain
Johnston in the valley, and General Johnston
reached Manassas with his army on the afternoon
of the 20th. General Longstreet was also
there, who some months later played a distinctive
part in the struggle at Gettysburg and in the
death grapple of Lee and Grant in the wilderness.</p>

<p>McDowell, after resting his troops for two days
at Centreville, thought the time for an engagement
was now at hand, so on Sunday, July 21st,
at half-past two in the morning, the men were
roused for the coming conflict. Their dream of
easy victory had already received a rude shock,
for on their second day at Centreville a skirmish
between two minor divisions of the opposing
armies resulted in the defeat of the Union forces
with some loss.</p>

<p>Ambrose E. Burnside and William T. Sherman
were at this time subordinate officers under
General McDowell. Burnside, who figured later
in the far more disastrous battle of Fredericksburg,
and Sherman, distinguished for his march
to the sea.</p>

<p>The Union plan was that General Tyler should
lead his division westward and cross Bull Run
at the Stone Bridge about four miles from Centreville,
and the remainder of the army under
Hunter and Heintzelman was to make a circuit
of several miles through a dense wood and
cross Bull Run at Sudley's Ford. The plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
was to attack the Confederate left wing. The
march to Sudley's Ford was slower than expected
and it was almost noon before this division
of the army reached the field near Stone Bridge.</p>

<p>General Tyler early in the day opened fire at
Stone Bridge on the Confederates under General
Evans, but merely kept up a desultory fire.
As the morning wore away the Confederates suddenly
discovered clouds of dust rising above the
treetops along the Warrenton turnpike, which
told them that the main Federal army was on
them. Evans quickly turned about and made
ready for battle and waited calmly for the approach
of the enemy. Presently there was a
glimmer of sunlight reflected from burnished
steel among the trees and Colonel Burnside led
the Federal army from the woods and without
delay the battle began and raged furiously.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Generals Beauregard and Johnston
were at Manassas, about four miles from the
scene of battle, with part of the Confederate
army, and had been planning an attack on the
Federal left, but on hearing the roar of the cannon
and the rattle of the musketry became convinced
that the Federals were making their
main attack on the Confederate left, and both
galloped at full speed to the scene of battle, after
leaving orders to the remainder of the army to
be brought up to reënforce the small force of
Confederates who were trying to hold back the
Federals. They arrived on the field at the
moment when General Bee's brigade was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
driven back. General Bee, in trying to rally his
men, called their attention to the fact that
Thos. J. Jackson's brigade was standing like a
stone wall, and it was here that Jackson won his
name of "Stonewall."</p>

<p>The battle raged furiously until 3 o'clock.
The chief object was to get possession of Henry's
Hill. Beauregard, like McDowell on the other
side, led his men in the thickest of the battle.
His horse was killed by a bursting shell, but he
mounted another and continued. At about 2
o'clock the Confederates were driven from the
field and McDowell thought he had won the victory,
but General Kirby Smith had arrived from
Manassas with the remainder of the Confederate
army and was now on the field, after a double-quick
march for four miles under a hot July sun.
Beauregard determined to make another effort
and ordered his troops forward with fresh courage.
When the Union army saw the Confederates
again approaching, supported by fresh
troops, their courage failed and they began to
retreat. McDowell tried in vain to rally his men,
the Confederates pressed on, the retreat of the
Federals became a panic. He again tried to
rally his men and make a stand at Centreville
but to no avail, the troops refused to listen to his
commands. Some of the troops did not stop
until they reached Washington, and the first
great battle of the Civil war was now over.</p>

<p>The Federal force engaged was about 19,000
men, of which the loss in killed, wounded and
missing was about 3,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
The Confederates had about 18,000 men on the
field, and their total loss in killed, wounded and
missing was about 2,000. McDowell and Beauregard,
the opposing commanders, were old-time
friends, having been in the same class at West
Point.</p>

<p>It was in this battle that Captain Ricketts was
severely wounded and left on the field, and was
carried a prisoner to Richmond by the Confederates.</p>

<p>To commemorate the success of the Southern
arms at Bull Run the Confederate congress voted
a day of Thanksgiving.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_SHILOH" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_SHILOH">THE BATTLE OF SHILOH</a></h2>

<p>Many battles had been fought in America, but
they were all skirmishes compared with Shiloh.
Napoleon fought but few battles on the Continent
of Europe that were more destructive of human
life.</p>

<p>In the beginning of April, 1862, General Albert
Sidney Johnston was in command of 40,000 Confederate
soldiers at Corinth, Miss., about twenty
miles from Pittsburgh Landing, on the Tennessee
River; the next in command was General Beauregard,
who had fought at Bull Run, and had
come to reënforce Johnston; General Bragg, of
Buena Vista fame, was there, to whom, at Buena
Vista, General Taylor had given the famous command,
"A little more grape, Captain Bragg."
General Leonidas Polk was with Johnston also.
He was called the "Fighting Bishop," for he
had been a bishop in the church after leaving
West Point.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Union army was gathering at
Pittsburgh Landing, under the command of General
Grant, and by April 5th numbered 40,000
men. Grant's plan was to attack the Confederates
at Corinth, within a few days, and at this
time was little expecting an immediate battle,
and had left his army in command of his subordinate
officers, and on the night of the 5th was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
some miles down the Tennessee from where his
army was encamped.</p>

<p>In the meantime Johnston was moving on the
Federals at Pittsburgh Landing, and on the night
of April 5th encamped within a mile of the
Federal lines.</p>

<p>At the break of day Sunday, April 6th, the
Confederate battle-lines moved from the woods
on the surrounding hills, and the greatest battle
yet fought in the Western Hemisphere was at
hand.</p>

<p>General Grant was at breakfast when he heard
the roar of the cannon, and made haste by boat
to take charge of his army.</p>

<p>General Hardee led the first Confederate attack
against the outlying division of the Federals
under General Benjamin Prentiss, of West Virginia.
Very soon a Confederate attack was made
all along the Federal line, led by Bragg, Polk
and Breckinridge. A determined stand was
made by the Federal division under General
W.&nbsp;T. Sherman, but was finally pushed back after
inflicting great slaughter to the Confederates.
About two and a half miles from the Landing,
in a grove of trees, stood a log church, known
to the country people as Shiloh, at which they
gathered on Sunday to worship, but on this
particular Sunday the demon of war reigned
supreme, and it goes without saying that the
regular service on this fateful Sunday was dispensed
with. About this church the battle raged
furiously. Near the same was a dense undergrowth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
which was held by General Prentiss
until late in the afternoon of the 6th, when his
entire division was surrounded and compelled to
surrender, after repulsing the Confederate attack
time after time with great slaughter. This
spot has since been known as the "Hornet's
Nest."</p>

<p>It was near this place that General Albert
Sidney Johnston received his death wound while
leading his troops, and in his death the Confederates
suffered irreparable loss. He was
struck in the leg by a minie ball, and if surgical
attention had been given him at once his life
would have been saved.</p>

<p>It is the belief of many that the death of Johnston
changed the result at Shiloh. Beauregard
succeeded to the command and continued the
battle. The utter rout of Grant's army was
saved only by the gunboats in the river. Beauregard
gave orders to suspend operations until
morning.</p>

<div id="ip_16" class="figcenter" style="width: 531px;"><img class="nobdr" src="images/i017.jpg" width="531" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE</div></div>

<p>The Confederates were left in charge of the
field on the first day and were in good hope of
victory. But ere long their hopes were mingled
with fear, for Beauregard had been expecting
General Van Dorn with 20,000 men to reënforce
him, but he had not arrived. On the other hand,
Generals Buell and Wallace arrived during the
night with 25,000 fresh troops to reënforce Grant.
Everyone knew the battle would be renewed at
the dawn of day. At the break of day, April 7th,
all was astir on the field of Shiloh, and the dawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
was greeted with the roar of the cannon and the
rattle of the musketry.</p>

<p>The Confederates were at a great disadvantage
as Van Dorn had not arrived, and they were
confronted by Grant's overwhelming numbers.
Shiloh church was again the storm center, and
was used by Beauregard as his headquarters.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Beauregard became convinced
that the battle was lost, and ordered a
retreat, which was skillfully made, for he maintained
a front firing-line, and the Federals did
not suspect his retreat for some time.</p>

<p>The Federals were left in possession of the
field, while Beauregard's troops were wading
through mud on their way to Corinth.</p>

<p>Nothing yet on the American continent had
ever been witnessed by any human being that
would equal the agony and woe that was endured
on this retreat; the road was almost impassable,
and the Confederate army, extending along
this road for six to eight miles, was struggling
along through a downpour of rain, which, ere
long, as night hovered over them, turned to hail
and sleet. There were wagons loaded with
wounded, whose wounds had not yet been attended.
The wounded that died on the way were
left by the wayside.</p>

<p>Some days after the battle Beauregard reported
to his government at Richmond as follows:
"This army is more confident of ultimate
success than before its encounter with the
enemy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
In his address to his soldiers he said: "You
have done your duty. Your countrymen are
proud of your deeds on the bloody field of Shiloh:
Confident of the ultimate result of your valor."</p>

<p>The two days at Shiloh were astonishing to
the American people. Bull Run was a skirmish
in comparison with Shiloh. The loss on each side
was more than 10,000 men. General Grant said
that after the battle there was an open field so
covered with dead that it would have been possible
to walk across it in any direction stepping
on dead bodies without the foot touching the
ground.</p>

<p>This proved a great victory for the Federals,
as it left them in full possession along the
Tennessee and in the surrounding country.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLES_OF_FAIR_OAKS_AND_SEVEN_PINES" id="THE_BATTLES_OF_FAIR_OAKS_AND_SEVEN_PINES">THE BATTLES OF FAIR OAKS AND SEVEN PINES</a></h2>

<p>After the battle of Bull Run the Union army
was broken up and unorganized. General George
B. McClellan was called to Washington to take
charge of the army, and in the beginning days of
1862 he found himself in command of 200,000
men. He set about to organize this army and
fit them for service. Presently public opinion
grew restless, and the North became tired of
"All's Quiet Along the Potomac."</p>

<p>About the middle of March McClellan moved
a large portion of his army on transports down
the Potomac to Fortress Monroe. On April 5th
he moved up the Peninsula toward Richmond.
He met with a Confederate force under General
Magruder near Yorktown, who fell back on Williamsburg
as the Union army advanced. At
Williamsburg he met a large Confederate force
under General J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Stuart, D.&nbsp;H. Hill and
Jubal Early. The Confederates were finally dislodged
and forced to retreat by the advance
divisions of McClellan's army under Hooker,
Kearny and Hancock, who occupied Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The Union army continued their march, and
on May 16th reached White House, the ancestral
home of the Lees, which is twenty-four miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
from Richmond. On every side were fields of
grain, and were it not for the presence of 100,000
men, there was the promise of a full harvest.</p>

<p>Great confusion reigned at the Confederate
capital on hearing of the advance of McClellan's
army. The Confederate army, known as the
Army of Northern Virginia, under the command
of General Joseph E. Johnston, was arrayed
against McClellan's army, known as the Army
of the Potomac. And thus was arrayed against
each other two of the greatest and best equipped
armies that had ever confronted each other on
the field of battle. It was now imminent that
this would be the beginning of a series of battles
between the Army of the Potomac and the Army
of Northern Virginia, ending three years thereafter
at Appomattox, where the veterans in gray
layed down their arms, in honor, to those in
blue.</p>

<p>Between these two armies lay the Chickahominy
River, which at this time was overflowing
its banks on account of recent heavy rains.
McClellan ordered his army forward May 20th,
and a large division under General Naglee succeeded
in crossing the river, and took up a position
on the south side of the stream. General
McClellan, however, was expecting to be reënforced
by McDowell from Fredericksburg with
40,000 men.</p>

<p>General Johnston, discovering the divided condition
of McClellan's army, believed that the
time had arrived to give battle. At this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
"Stonewall" Jackson, with his army, was in the
Valley of Virginia, and was seriously threatening
Washington. The authorities at Washington
deemed it necessary to recall McDowell and
thus prevent him from reënforcing McClellan,
which proved to be a very serious disappointment
to him. McClellan ordered two divisions
of his army to advance. One, commanded by
General Casey, stationed itself at Fair Oaks
farm, and the other, under General Couch, entrenched
itself at the cross-roads near Seven
Pines, which derives its name from a clump of
pine trees, from which the battle fought here
derives its name.</p>

<p>No sooner had these positions been taken than
they began to entrench themselves and throw
out their picket lines, for the advance division
of the Confederates could plainly be seen through
the timber lines.</p>

<p>On May 30th Johnston gave orders for his
army to be ready to advance at daybreak, but
during the night a very heavy rain fell and
delayed operations until late in the morning of
May 31st. About nine o'clock, however, the
forces of Longstreet and Hill were ready to
move, and advanced rapidly through the woods
on the outlying division of the Federals, who
made a stubborn defense, driving back the Confederates
time after time at the point of the
bayonet, and the last time pressing them back
to the woods. Here they were met by a furious
musketry fire by fresh men from Longstreet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
division or infantry. They quickly gave way,
and retreated in confusion back to their entrenchments
near Fair Oaks farm. Here the
Federals took a stubborn stand, but were presently
dislodged with great slaughter by an enfilading
fire from the brigades of Rains and
Rhodes, who had come up on each side.</p>

<p>The Federals fell back to Seven Pines, where
Couch's division was stationed. Their situation
was growing critical, although they were making
a determined stand and had been reënforced by
Heintzelman's division. In the meantime Hill
had been reënforced by a brigade of Longstreet's
division and was making a fierce attack on the
Federals. The Confederates were further reënforced
by the division of General G.&nbsp;W. Smith.
The battle raged furiously until late in the evening,
when the Federals fell back a distance of
about two miles within their entrenchments along
the river.</p>

<p>While this battle was being fought, another at
Fair Oaks Station, only a short distance away,
was also being fought, in which General Joseph
E. Johnston was seriously wounded by a bursting
shell, and was carried from the field. He
was succeeded in command by General Robert
E. Lee, who was afterwards made the commander
in chief of all the Southern forces, although the
immediate command fell upon G.&nbsp;W. Smith.</p>

<p>Early Sunday morning, June 1st, the battle was
renewed and the attack was again made by the
Confederates, led by General Smith, supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
by Longstreet, but they were pushed back with
great slaughter. The Union lines were also
broken and a brief lull ensued. Both sides were
gathering themselves for another onslaught.
Presently the Federals were reënforced by the
division of General Hooker. They marched
upon the field in double quick time, and were
met by a withering artillery fire. Both attacking
divisions were ordered forward with fixed
bayonets. The Confederates finally gave way
and fell back toward Richmond, and the Federals
again withdrew to their entrenchment along
the river.</p>

<p>It is thought by many that McClellan's failure
to follow up the Confederates proved to be the
final failure of his Peninsula campaign, for it
gave the Confederates time to readjust their
army under their new commander.</p>

<p>The forest paths were strewn with the dead
and dying. Many of the wounded were compelled
to lie in the hot sun for hours before
help could reach them. Many of the Federal
wounded were placed upon cars and taken across
the Chickahominy. The Confederate wounded
were carried to Richmond, which was only seven
miles away. And many of the Confederate dead
at Seven Pines were buried in the Holly Wood
cemetery at Richmond, where there are 16,000
Confederate dead. At Oak Wood cemetery,
which is near by, there is another 16,000, which
makes 32,000 buried at Richmond.</p>

<p>At this time the defense of Washington was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
giving McClellan, as well as other Federal authorities,
considerable concern, for Jackson with
his army had previously taken possession of
Winchester and was advancing down the valley.
The Federals opposed to Jackson were commanded
by Generals Shields and Banks. Jackson
made an attack on Shields' army at Kernstown
and drove the Federals back, but presently
fell back to wait reënforcements under Ewell.
The Federals were reënforced by General Fremont.
Jackson's activity in the valley caused
the president to fear that his goal was Washington.
The two armies fought a series of
battles in the valley, namely: Front Royal,
Strausburg, Newtown and Port Republic, the
last-named being the far more important and
destructive to life. These were a series of victories
for Jackson, for he drove the Federals
from place to place, and 3,000 of Banks' men
fell into his hands as prisoners. Banks retreated
across the Potomac and Jackson joined Lee before
Richmond.</p>

<p>Jackson's activity and strategy in the movement
of his army surprised both the North and
the South. Banks reported to the government
at Washington that "Jackson aimed at nothing
less than the capture of our entire force."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SEVEN_DAYS_BATTLES" id="THE_SEVEN_DAYS_BATTLES">THE SEVEN DAYS' BATTLES</a></h2>

<p>Early in the summer of 1862, General Lee proceeded
to increase his fighting force so as to
make it more nearly equal in number to that of
McClellan, and to that end every man that could
be spared from other sections in the South was
called to Richmond. Numerous intrenchments
were thrown up along the roads and in the fields
about Richmond, thus giving it the appearance
of a fortified camp. General Lee, in an address
to his troops, said that the army had made its
last retreat.</p>

<p>Each army at this time numbered in the neighborhood
of 100,000 men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, McClellan's army was acclimating
itself to a Virginia summer, and now that the
sweltering heat of June was coming on, the
swamps about their camps were fountains of
disease, which began to tell on the health of the
men. The hospitals were crowded, and the
death rate was appalling.</p>

<p>McClellan proceeded to transfer all his men
to the south side of the Chickahominy River, excepting
the corps of Franklin and Porter, which
were left on the north side of the river to await
reënforcements under General McCall, which
arrived about the middle of June.</p>

<p>General Lee sent a division of his cavalry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
under the command of J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Stuart, to encircle
the army of McClellan. Stuart started in
the direction of Fredericksburg June 12th, as if to
reënforce Jackson, and the first night bivouacked
in the pine woods of Hanover county. Then,
turning to the east, he soon came upon a Union
force, drawn up in columns of four, ready to
dispute the passage of the road, and which fell
back in confusion as the Confederates advanced.
Stuart pushed on and fell upon a company of
Federal infantry at Tunstall's Station, which
surrendered at once. The Confederates quickly
turned about, crossed the Chickahominy River
and joined Lee's army before Richmond, thus
giving Lee the desired information of the position
of McClellan's army.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, General "Stonewall" Jackson with
his army was making haste to join Lee's army,
and on June 25th reached Ashland, in striking
distance of the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>McClellan was pushing his men forward to
begin the siege of Richmond. His advance guard
was within four miles of the Confederate capital,
and his fond hope was that within a few days at
most his artillery would be belching forth its
sheets of fire and lead into the beleaguered city.</p>

<p>In front of the Union camp was a strip of pine
woodland, full of ponds and marshes. The
Union soldiers pressed through this thicket, met
the Confederate pickets among the trees and
drove them back. Upon emerging into the open
the Federal troops found it filled with rifle pits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
earth works, and redoubts. At once they were
met with a steady and incessant fire, which continued
nearly all day, and at times almost reached
the magnitude of a battle. This is sometimes
called the second battle of Fair Oaks, and was
the prelude of the Seven Days' battles.</p>

<p>The extreme right of the Union line, under
command of General Porter, lay near Mechanicsville,
on the Upper Chickahominy. It was
strongly entrenched and was almost impregnable
to an attack from the front. Before sunrise,
June 26th, the Confederates were at the Chickahominy
bridge awaiting the arrival of Jackson,
but for once Jackson was behind time. The
morning hours came and went. Noon came and
Jackson had not arrived. About the middle of
the afternoon, General A.&nbsp;P. Hill, growing impatient,
crossed the river at Meadow bridge, and
at Mechanicsville was joined by the divisions of
Longstreet and D.&nbsp;H. Hill. Driving the Union
outpost to cover, the Confederates swept across
the low approach to Beaver Dam Creek through
a murderous fire from the batteries on the cliff,
but were finally repulsed with severe loss. Later
in the afternoon relief was sent Hill, who again
attempted to force the Union position at Ellerson's
Mill. From across the open fields, and in
full view of the defenders of the cliff, the Confederates
moved down the slope in full range
of the Federal batteries, but the fire was reserved
by the Federals. As the approaching columns
reached the stream the shells came screaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
through the air from every waiting field-piece.
Volley after volley of musketry was poured into
the ranks of the Southerners. The hillside was
soon covered by the victims of the gallant charge.
As darkness hovered over them there were no
signs of the cessation of the combat. It was
nine o'clock when Hill finally drew back his
shattered forces to await the coming of the morning.
The Forty-fourth Georgia regiment suffered
the loss of all of its officers, and thereby
was unable to re-form its broken ranks. Both
armies now prepared for another day of conflict.</p>

<p>McClellan became convinced that Jackson was
really approaching with a large force, and decided
to change his base to the James River,
leaving Porter with the Fifth corps on the banks
of the Chickahominy, to prevent Jackson from
interrupting this gigantic movement. It involved
marching an army of 100,000 men, with
a train of 5,000 heavily loaded wagons, and
many siege-guns, together with 3,000 cattle to
be driven across the marshy peninsula.</p>

<p>On the night of the 26th, McCall's division was
directed to fall back to the bridges across the
Chickahominy near Gaines' Mill, and there make
a stand, for the purpose of holding back the
Confederates. Just before daylight the operations
of moving the troops began.</p>

<p>The Confederates were equally alert, and
opened a heavy fire upon the retreating columns.
The Union force under McCall, by being skillfully
handled, succeeded in reaching their new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
position on the Chickahominy heights, and on
the morning of the new day made ready for
action. The selection of this ground had been
well made; they occupied a series of heights
fronted on the west by a cycle shaped stream.
The land beyond was an open country, through
which a creek meandered sluggishly, and beyond
this a densely tangled undergrowth. Around
the Union position also were many patches of
woods, affording cover for the reserves.</p>

<p>To protect the Federals, trees had been felled
along their front, out of which barriers, protected
by rails and knapsacks, were erected.</p>

<p>Jackson's forces had united with those of Longstreet
and the two Hills, and were advancing with
grim determination of victory.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock, on June 28th, when General
A.&nbsp;P. Hill swung his division into line for
the attack. He was unsupported by the other
divisions, which had not yet arrived on the field.
His columns moved rapidly toward the Union
front, and was met by a hailstorm of lead from
Porter's artillery, which sent messages of death
to the approaching lines of gray.</p>

<p>The Confederate front recoiled from the incessant
outpour of grape, canister and shell.
The repulse threw the Confederates into great
confusion. Many left the field in disorder.
Others threw themselves on the ground to escape
the withering fire, while some held their places.</p>

<p>The Federals were reënforced by General Slocum's
division of Franklin's corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Lee ordered a general attack upon the entire
Union front. Reënforcements were brought up
to take the place of the shattered regiments. The
troops moved forward in the face of a heavy fire
and pressed up the hillside against the Union
line at fearful sacrifice. It was a death grapple
for the mastery of the field.</p>

<p>At this time General Lee observed Hood of
Jackson's corps coming down the road bringing
his brigade into the fight. Riding forward to
meet him, Lee directed that he should try to
break the Union line. Hood, in addressing his
troops, said that no man should fire until ordered,
then started for the Union breastwork 800 yards
away. They moved rapidly across the open under
a shower of shot and shell. At every step
the ranks grew thinner and thinner. They quickened
their pace as they passed down the slope
and across the creek. Not a shot had they fired.
With the wing of death hovering over all, they
fixed bayonets and, dashing up the hill into the
Federals' line, with a shout they plunged through
the felled timber and over the breastworks. The
Union line had been pierced and was giving way,
and the retreat was threatening to develop into
a general rout. But the Federals at this moment
were reënforced by the brigades of French and
Meagher of Sumner's corps. This stopped the
pursuit and, as night was at hand, the Southern
soldiers withdrew. The battle of Gaines' Mill
was then over.</p>

<p>General Lee believed that McClellan would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
retreat down the Peninsula, but on June 29th,
this being the next day after the battle of Gaines'
Mill, he became convinced that the Federals were
moving towards the James River. Longstreet
and A.&nbsp;P. Hill were again ordered to take up the
pursuit of the Federals.</p>

<p>McClellan had left Sumner to guard his retreating
columns. Sumner followed up in the
rear of the Federals and brought his men to a
halt at what is known as the "Peach Orchard,"
near Savage's Station, and successfully resisted
the spirited fire of musketry and artillery of the
Confederates. On this same Sunday evening he
was attacked by General Magruder with a large
force, who was following close on the heels of
the Army of the Potomac. Magruder brought
his artillery into action, but failed to dislodge
the Federals. He then charged the Union breastworks
and was met with a vigorous fire, and the
battle raged over the entire field. Both sides
stood their ground until darkness closed the contest.
The battle of Savage's Station was now
over. Before midnight Sumner had withdrawn
his forces and was following after the wagon
trains of McClellan.</p>

<p>The Confederates were pursuing McClellan in
two columns, one led by Jackson and the other
by Longstreet. The division under Longstreet
came upon the Federals at Glendale, where they
were guarding the right flank of the retreat.
The Federals were attacked by a part of Longstreet's
division led by General McCall, but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
repulsed with great loss. Longstreet ordered a
general attack. One Alabama brigade charged
across the field in the face of the Union batteries.
The men had to go a distance of 600 yards. The
batteries let loose grape and canister, while
volley after volley of musketry sent its death-dealing
messages among the Southerners. But
nothing except grim death itself could check their
impetuous charge. Pausing for an instant, they
delivered a volley of musketry and attempted
to seize the guns. Bayonets were crossed and
men engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle. Darkness
closed on the fearful scene, yet the fighting
continued. The Federals finally withdrew from
the field to follow up their retreating columns.</p>

<p>There fell into the hands of the Confederates
a field hospital, filled with the wounded, gathered
from the fields of Gaines' Mill, Savage's Station
and Glendale. These wounded were taken charge
of as prisoners, along with their attending physicians.
This proved to be a great burden to the
Confederates, as they were taxed to their utmost
caring for their own wounded.</p>

<p>By this series of engagements McClellan was
enabled to reach Malvern Hill, on the James
River, with his army intact. By noon on July 1st
his last division had reached its position. The
Confederates, led by Longstreet, were close on
his trail, and were soon brought up to the Union
outposts.</p>

<div id="ip_32" class="figcenter" style="width: 531px;"><img class="nobdr" src="images/i035.jpg" width="531" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">GENERAL ULYSSES S. GRANT</div></div>

<p>Malvern Hill, a plateau a mile and a half long
and half a mile wide, with its top bare of woods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
commanded a view of the country over which the
Confederates must approach. Around the summit
of this hill McClellan had placed tier after
tier of batteries, arranged like an amphitheater.
On the top were placed several heavy siege guns,
his left flank being protected by the gunboats
in the river. The morning and early afternoon
were occupied by several Confederate attacks,
sometimes formidable in their nature, but Lee
planned for no general move until he could bring
up a force which he thought sufficient to attack
the strong position of the Federals. The Confederates
had orders to advance, when a signal
shout was given by the men of Armistead's
brigade. The attack was made late in the afternoon
by General D.&nbsp;H. Hill, and was gallantly
done, but no army could have withstood the fire
from the batteries of McClellan as they were
massed upon Malvern Hill. All during the evening
brigade after brigade tried to force the Union
lines. They were forced to breast one of the
most devastating storms of lead and canister to
which an assaulting army has ever been subjected.
The round shot and grape cut through
the branches of the trees. Column after column
of Southern soldiers rushed upon the death dealing
cannon, only to be mowed down. Their thin
lines rallied again and again to the charge, but
to no avail. McClellan's batteries still hurled
their missiles of death. The field below was covered
with the dead, as mute pleaders in the cause
of peace. The heavy shells from the gunboats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
on the river shrieked through the timber and
great limbs were torn from the trees as they
hurtled by. Darkness was falling over the combatants.
It was nine o'clock before the guns
ceased firing, and only an occasional shot rang
out over the gory field of Malvern Hill.</p>

<p>The next day the Confederates, looking up
through the drenching rain to where had stood
the grim batteries and lines of blue, saw only
deserted ramparts. The Federal army had retreated
during the night to Harrison's Landing,
where it remained until August.</p>

<p>President Lincoln became convinced that the
operations from the James River as a base were
impracticable, and orders were issued for the
army to be withdrawn from the peninsula.</p>

<p>The net result of the Seven Days' Battles was
a disappointment to the South, as the Southern
public believed that McClellan should not have
been allowed to reach the James River with his
army intact, although the siege of Richmond had
been raised.</p>

<p>Generals McClellan, Jackson, A.&nbsp;P. Hill, G.&nbsp;W.
Smith, Joseph E. Johnston and Lee, as well as
other commanding officers of this series of battles
about Richmond, had been great friends.
Some of them had attended school together at
West Point, and many of them had enjoyed each
other's fellowship while members of the Aztec
Club in the City of Mexico, which was an organization
of American officers, while for a few
months they were in the Mexican capital at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
close of the Mexican war. General Franklin
Pierce was president of the club, who was afterwards
President of the United States.</p>

<p>Generals McClellan and Joseph E. Johnston
were special friends even after the war, and in
a conversation with McClellan Johnston remarked
"You never know what is in a man until you try

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_CEDAR_MOUNTAIN" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_CEDAR_MOUNTAIN">THE BATTLE OF CEDAR MOUNTAIN</a></h2>

<p>After the failure of McClellan's Peninsula
campaign General John Pope was called from
the West to Washington to take charge of the
Union forces, and arrived in June, 1862. A new
army was made up from the respective divisions
of McDowell, Banks and Fremont, which was
to be known as the Army of Virginia. General
Pope at first refused to take command of this
army, for the reason that McDowell, Banks and
Fremont were superior officers in rank to himself,
but was prevailed upon to take the command,
which he did, and in an address to his
army he ended with the statement, "My headquarters
will be in the saddle." When this was
shown to General Lee, he grimly commented,
"Perhaps his headquarters will be where his
hindquarters ought to be."</p>

<p>Fremont refused to serve under Pope, whom
he considered his junior, and resigned. His
corps was assigned to General Sigel.</p>

<p>Pope's idea was to draw Lee's army away
from following that of McClellan down the
peninsula, and advanced from Washington with
Gordonsville as his objective point. This place,
being at the junction of a railroad, was a base
of supplies for the Southern army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
The sagacious Lee had divined his intentions
and sent Stonewall Jackson and Ewell to occupy
this town. Ewell arrived in advance of Jackson,
and held the town. Jackson, coming up
later, took full command of the army.</p>

<p>On July 27th, A.&nbsp;P. Hill also joined him with
his corps, which brought their strength up to
about 25,000 men.</p>

<p>The Union army now occupied that portion
of the country around Culpeper Court House.
Pope soon found that his brilliant success in the
West was not like measuring swords with the
Confederate generals in Virginia.</p>

<p>On August 6th Pope began his general advance
on Gordonsville. Jackson, being informed
of his advance, immediately set his
army in motion for Culpeper Court House,
hoping to crush the Army of Virginia before it
reached the neighborhood of Gordonsville, so
as to nowise interrupt their base of supplies.
Jackson succeeded in crossing the Rapidan
River and took a strong position two miles beyond
on Cedar Mountain, which is a foothill
of the Blue Ridge. From its summit could be
seen vast stretches of quiet farm lands, which
had borne their annual harvest since the days
of the Cavaliers. Its slopes were covered with
forests, which merged into waving grain fields
and pasture lands, dotted here and there with
rural homes. It was on these slopes that one
of the most severe short battles of the war was
fought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Jackson placed Ewell's batteries on the slope
about 200 feet above the valley, and General
Winder took a strong position on the left.</p>

<p>General Pope well knew that the whole North
was eagerly watching his movements, and resolved
to make an attack, as he must strike somewhere,
and do it soon&mdash;and here was his chance.
He sent Banks, with 8,000 men, to make the attack
against the Southerners in their strong position
on the mountain side.</p>

<p>Banks advanced against the enemy on the
afternoon of August 9th. He advanced through
open fields in full range of the Confederate
cannon, which presently opened with roar of
thunder. The men, heedless of all danger,
pressed on up the slope, but were suddenly met
by a brigade of Ewell's division, and a brief
deadly encounter took place. The Confederate
lines began to waver, and no doubt would have
been routed but for the timely aid of two
brigades which rallied to their support. Meanwhile
the Union batteries had been wheeled into
position and their roar answered that of the
Confederates on the hill. For three hours the
battle continued with utmost fury. The fields
were strewn with the dead and dying, who fell
to rise no more. At length, as the shades of
evening were settling over the gory field, Banks
began to withdraw his troops, but left 2,000 of
his brave men&mdash;one-fourth of his whole army&mdash;dead
or dying along the hillside. The Confederate
losses were about 1,300. On account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of the peculiar situation of the armies during
the battle, their wounded could not be taken
charge of, who suffered terribly from thirst and
lack of attention as the sultry day gave way to
a close, oppressive night. For two days the
armies faced each other across the valley, then
quietly withdrew.</p>

<p>Pope's first battle, as leader of the Army of
Virginia, had resulted in neither victory nor
defeat. This battle was a prelude to a far more
disastrous battle to be fought a few days later
at Bull Run.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SECOND_BATTLE_OF_BULL_RUN" id="SECOND_BATTLE_OF_BULL_RUN">SECOND BATTLE OF BULL RUN</a></h2>

<p>The three weeks intervening between the battles
of Cedar Mountain and Second Bull Run
were spent in heavy skirmishing and getting
position for a decisive battle. General Pope's
headquarters was at Culpeper Court House,
but he had left much of his personal baggage
and private papers at Catlett's Station, on the
Orange and Alexandria railroad, while his vast
store of supplies was at Manassas Junction.</p>

<p>Pope was expecting to be reënforced by McClellan,
but they had not yet arrived. Meanwhile
Lee had sent Longstreet with his corps to
reënforce Jackson, and followed up later himself.
Longstreet reached Gordonsville on the
13th day of August.</p>

<p>Lee observed that Pope's position was weak at
Culpeper and determined to attack him without
delay and gave orders for his army to cross the
Rapidan. Pope knew that his position at Culpeper
was weak and fell back to a stronger position
behind the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>Lee hoped to attack the Army of Virginia
before it could be reënforced by McClellan, but,
on account of heavy rains, which raised the
streams, he was somewhat delayed until Pope
had been reënforced by a part of Burnside's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
corps, under General Reno, and later was also
reënforced by Generals Kearny and Reynolds
with their divisions of the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>Lee sent the dauntless cavalry leader J.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.
Stuart to make a raid around the Union army.
Stuart crossed the Rappahannock with 1,500
mounted men, as bold as himself. After riding
all day, and on the night of the 22d, in the
midst of a torrential rainstorm, while the darkness
was so intense that every man was guided
by the tread of his brother horseman, Stuart fell
upon the Federals at Catlett's Station, capturing
200 prisoners and scattering the remaining
troops in the darkness. He seized Pope's dispatch-book,
with his plans and private papers,
took several hundred horses and destroyed a
large number of wagons loaded with supplies.
Among his trophies was a fine uniform cloak
and hat, which were the personal belongings of
General Pope. These were exchanged later for
General Stuart's plumed hat, which he had left
behind when surprised by a party of Federals.</p>

<p>Stuart's raid proved a serious misfortune for
Pope's army. But Lee had far greater things
in store. He resolved to send Jackson to Pope's
rear with a large force, Jackson led his army
westward, which was shielded by woods and
low hills of the Blue Ridge. He passed through
a quiet rural community. The majority of the
country folk had never seen an army before,
though it is true that for many days they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
heard the roar of the cannon from the valley
of the Rapidan.</p>

<p>General Lee, in the meantime, had kept Longstreet
in front of Pope's army to make daily
demonstrations, to divert Pope's attention from
Jackson's movements and lead him to believe
that he was to be attacked in front.</p>

<p>Jackson suddenly, on August 26th, emerged
from the Bull Run Mountains and marshaled his
clans on the plains of Manassas.</p>

<p>Pope was astonished to find Jackson in his
rear, and hastened with all speed with his forces
toward Manassas Junction, where he had vast
stores of provisions and munitions of war, but
he was too late to save them. They had been
taken by General Stuart in advance of Jackson's
army. This was a serious loss to Pope. The
spoils of the capture were great, including 300
prisoners, 125 horses, ten locomotives, seven long
trains of provisions, and vast stores and munitions
of war. Pope was moving against Jackson
with a far larger army, and was expecting
to be reënforced from the Army of the Potomac,
while on the other hand, Longstreet was hastening
to reënforce Jackson, but had not arrived.</p>

<p>Pope, hoping to crush Jackson's army before
he could be reënforced by Longstreet, sent a
force to interpose Longstreet at Thoughfare
Gap. Jackson was not to be caught in a trap.
He moved from Manassas Junction to the old
battlefield of Bull Run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Late in the afternoon of the 29th he encountered
King's division of McDowell's corps, near
the village of Groveton, and a sharp fight was
opened and kept up until after dark.</p>

<p>On the following day, August 29th, the first
day's battle was fought. Pope was still hopeful
of crushing Jackson's army before the arrival
of Longstreet, and ordered a general advance
across Bull Run.</p>

<p>Ere long a loud shout arose from Jackson's
men that told too well of the arrival of Longstreet.
Far away on the hills could be seen the
marching columns of Longstreet, who had passed
through the gap in safety and was now rushing
upon the field. Pope had lost the opportunity
of fighting the army of his opponent in
sections.</p>

<p>The field was almost the same that the opposing
armies had occupied the year before, when
the first great battle of the war was fought, and
many of them were the same men.</p>

<p>The two armies faced each other in a line five
miles long. Late in the afternoon, the regiments,
under Kearny and Hooker, charged the
Confederate left, which was swept back and
rolled upon the center. But presently General
Hood, with his famous Texan brigade, rushed
forward in a wild, irresistible dash, pressed the
Federals back and captured several prisoners.</p>

<p>Darkness closed over the scene and the two
armies rested on their arms until morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Over the gory field lay multitudes of men who
would dream of battlefields no more.</p>

<p>Lee and Pope each believed that the other
would withdraw his army during the night, and
each was surprised in the morning to find his
opponent on the field. It was quite certain that
on this day, August 30th, there would be a decisive
battle, in which one army would be victor
and the other defeated. Both armies were in
full force, the Confederates with over 50,000
men, whose left wing was commanded by Jackson
and the right by Longstreet, and the Union
army with about 65,000 men, whose left wing
was commanded by Porter and the right by
Keno.</p>

<p>In the early hours of the morning the hills
echoed with the firing of artillery. Porter made
an infantry attack in the forenoon, and was
pressed back in great confusion by superior
numbers. One attack after another followed.
In the afternoon a large part of the Union army
made a desperate attack on the Confederate left,
under Jackson, but their lines were swept by an
enfilading fire from the batteries of Longstreet.
Ghastly gaps were cut in the Federal ranks, and
they fell back, but rallied again and again to
the attack, each time to be mowed down by
Longstreet's artillery. At length Longstreet's
whole line rushed forward and the Union front
began to waver. General Lee ordered a general
advance. Pope retreated across Bull Run, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
several thousand prisoners in the hands of
the Confederates.</p>

<p>Pope led his army back to the entrenchments
at Washington, while Jackson and Stuart followed
close on the heels of his army, and he was
compelled to make several stands in battle on his
retreat, in one of which General Kearny was
killed.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="BATTLE_OF_ANTIETAM" id="BATTLE_OF_ANTIETAM">BATTLE OF ANTIETAM</a></h2>

<p>After Pope's disastrous defeat at Second Bull
Run he begged to be relieved of the command
of the army. He gave as one of the causes of
his defeat that General Fitz John Porter had
disobeyed orders. General Porter's explanation
to the Court Marshal failed to convince it and
he was dismissed from the service.</p>

<p>The Army of Virginia and that of the Potomac
being united, the command was handed
to the "Little Napoleon" of Peninsula fame,
George B. McClellan.</p>

<p>The South was overjoyed with its victory at
Bull Run&mdash;twice it had unfurled its banner in
triumph on this battlefield&mdash;twice its army had
stood on the road that leads to Washington, only
by some strange destiny of war to fail to enter
it on the wave of victory.</p>

<p>This subject, "The Battle of Antietam," is
considered one of the turning points of the war,
for it was after this battle that President Lincoln
issued his emancipation proclamation, although
it is said that he had it prepared for some time
but on account of the continued defeat of his
armies in Virginia he could not see his way clear
to declare it until after the battle of Antietam.</p>

<p>Lee's army, 50,000 strong, crossed the Potomac
and concentrated around Frederick, Md., only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
about forty miles from Washington. When it
became known that Lee was advancing into
Maryland and was threatening Washington, McClellan
pushed his forces forward to encounter
the invaders. The people of the vicinity, and
even at Harrisburg, Baltimore and Philadelphia,
were filled with consternation. Their fear was
intensified by the memory of Second Bull Run,
a few weeks before, and by the fact that at this
time General Bragg was marching northward
across Kentucky with a great army, threatening
Louisville and Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Lee sent Jackson against the Union forces at
Harper's Ferry, which is at the junction of the
Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, at which place
there were stored valuable stores and munitions
of war. This place was made famous by John
Brown's raid a few years before.</p>

<p>Jackson reached the neighborhood of Harper's
Ferry on the morning of the 13th, and captured
the town with but little opposition on the morning
of the 15th. There were turned over to him
11,500 prisoners, seventy-three guns, 13,000
small arms, 200 wagons, and a large store of
supplies. In this enterprise Lee had achieved
an important and valuable success.</p>

<p>Longstreet, who had advanced to Hagerstown,
probably with the intention of invading Pennsylvania,
was hastily recalled and sent to reënforce
D.&nbsp;H. Hill, who was being severely pushed
at Boonsborough Gap by McClellan. The defense
of this path had been very necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Lee, but, after a desperate conflict, the Union
army succeeded in forcing its way through, this
being the first set-back to Lee's invasion, and
he conceived at once that a great battle was at
hand and began to concentrate his forces.</p>

<p>Jackson was marching with all haste to Sharpsburg,
near by Antietam Creek, having left A.&nbsp;P.
Hill to receive the surrender at Harper's Ferry,
and on the morning of the 16th the whole army,
with the exception of the force of A.&nbsp;P. Hill, left
at Harper's Ferry, was concentrated behind Antietam
Creek.</p>

<p>McClellan's army reached the opposite side of
the stream on the same day.</p>

<p>The bulk of the Confederate forces, under
Longstreet and D.&nbsp;H. Hill, stood along the range
of heights between Sharpsburg and Antietam
Creek, with Longstreet on the right and Hill
on the left, and Hood's division on the Hagerstown
road north of Miller's farm, and near that
point, in the rear, Jackson's exhausted troops
were in reserve.</p>

<p>His lines, stretching from the Hagerstown road
towards the Potomac, were protected by Stuart's
cavalry. General Lee had his headquarters in
a tent on a hill near Sharpsburg, where the
National Cemetery now is, and from that point
he overlooked much of the country that was
made a battlefield the next day.</p>

<div id="ip_48" class="figcenter" style="width: 478px;"><img src="images/i053.jpg" width="478" height="600" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">JOHN BROWN ON HIS WAY TO THE GALLOWS</div></div>

<p>Antietam Creek was spanned by four stone
bridges, which were strongly guarded.</p>

<p>McClellan made his headquarters at the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
brick mansion of Philip Pry, about two miles
east of Antietam. His army was posted in front
on each side, one wing under Sumner and the
other under Hooker. Farther down the stream,
and not far from bridge No. 3, Burnside's
corps was posted. McClellan's artillery was
planted on the hills in front of Sumner and
Hooker. This was the general position of the
contending armies on the 16th.</p>

<p>This was a day of intense anxiety and unrest
in the valley of the Antietam. The people, who
had lived in the farm houses that dotted the
golden autumn landscape in this hitherto quiet
community, had now abandoned their homes and
given place to the gathering thousands who were
marching to the stern command of the officers.
It was a day of maneuvering and getting position
preparatory to the coming mighty conflict.</p>

<p>The two great armies now lay facing each
other in a grand double line three miles in
length. At one point they were so near together
that the pickets could hear each other tread.
It would require no prophet to foretell what
would happen on the morrow.</p>

<p>On the night of the 16th few officers found
relief from anxiety, and it goes without saying
that many a soldier on this particular night,
with his mind on the battle which was to be
fought on the morrow, did not close his eyes in
slumber.</p>

<p>Beautiful and clear the morning broke over
the Maryland hills on the fateful 17th of September,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
1862. The sunlight had not yet touched
the crowned hilltops when artillery fire announced
the opening of the battle. The contest
was opened by Hooker with about 8,000 men.
He made a vigorous attack on the Confederate
left, commanded by Jackson, and was supported
by Doubleday on the right, and Meade on the
left. He had not gone far before the glint of
the rising sun disclosed the bayonet points of a
large Confederate force standing in a cornfield
in his immediate front. This was a part of
Jackson's corps, who had arrived during the
morning of the 16th from the capture of Harper's
Ferry, and had been posted in this position
to surprise Hooker in his advance. The
outcome was a terrible surprise to the Confederates.
Hooker's batteries hurried into action
and opened with canister on the cornfield.
Hooker's object was to push the Confederates
back through a line of woods and seize the
Hagerstown road and the woods beyond in the
vicinity of the Dunker church. Around this
church on this fateful day the demon of war
reigned supreme, and near this church stood
the fine mansion of a Mr. Mumma, which was
fired by a retreating column of Confederate
troops and burned throughout the entire engagement.
The Federal batteries on the east
side of the Antietam poured an enfilading fire
on Jackson that galled him very much. The
Confederates stood bravely against this fire and
made a determined resistance. Back, and still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
further back, were Jackson's men driven across
the field, every stalk of corn in which was cut
down by the shot and shell as closely as a knife
could have done it. On the ground the fallen
lay in rows, precisely as they had stood in the
ranks. The Confederates were driven from the
cornfield into a patch of woods. Hooker now
advanced his center under Meade to seize the
Hagerstown road and the woods beyond. They
were met by a murderous fire from Jackson, who
had just been reënforced by Hood's refreshed
troops, who fell heavily upon Meade in the cornfield.
Hooker called upon Doubleday for aid,
and a brigade was forwarded at double-quick
across the cornfield in the face of a terrible storm
of shot and shell. The Federals were further
reënforced by Mansfield's corps, and while his
divisions were deploying this veteran commander
was mortally wounded. General Williams
succeeded to the command of his corps, who
pushed on across the open fields and seized a
part of the woods on the Hagerstown road. At
the same time Greene's division took position to
the left of the Dunker church. This was on high
ground and was the key to the Confederate left
wing. But Greene's troops were exposed to a
galling fire from the division of D.&nbsp;H. Hill and
he called for reënforcements. General Sumner
sent Sedgwick's division across the creek to reënforce
Greene. His troops advanced straight
towards the conflict. They found General
Hooker severely wounded in the foot, which became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
so painful that he was carried off the field
and left his troops in the command of Sumner.
A sharp artillery fire was turned on Sedgwick
before he reached the woods, west of the Hagerstown
Pike, but once in the shelter of the thick
trees he passed in safety to the western edge.
Here the division found itself in an ambush.</p>

<p>The Confederates had been heavily reënforced
by several brigades under Walker and McLaws,
having just arrived from Harper's Ferry, and
had not only blocked the front but had worked
around to the rear of Sedgwick, who was wounded
in the awful slaughter that followed, but he and
Sumner finally extricated their men after severe
loss. The Federals were now reënforced by
Franklin's fresh troops and were able to hold
the cornfield and part of the woods over which
the conflict had raged till the ground was
saturated with blood.</p>

<p>Sedgwick was twice wounded and carried from
the field. The command of his division involved
on General Howard.</p>

<p>It was now about noon and the battle had been
raging since early in the morning. Another
deadly conflict was in progress near the center.
Sumner's corps had crossed the stream and made
a desperate assault on the Confederates under
D.&nbsp;H. Hill, stationed to the south of where the
battle had previously raged and along a sunken
road, since known as "Bloody Lane." The
fighting here was of a most desperate character
and continued nearly four hours. The Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
advance was led by Generals French and Richardson,
who captured a few flags and several
prisoners, but failed to carry the heights along
which the Confederates were posted. Richardson
was mortally wounded while leading a charge
and was succeeded by General Hancock, but his
men finally captured Bloody Lane with the 300
living men who remained to defend it.</p>

<p>The final Federal charge was made at this
point by Colonel Barlow, who displayed the utmost
bravery, where he won a brigadier-generalship.
He was later wounded and carried off the
field. The Confederates had fought desperately
to hold their position at Bloody Lane, and when
it was captured it was filled with dead bodies. It
was now after one o'clock and the firing ceased
for the day on the Union right and center.</p>

<p>General Burnside was in command of the Federal
left wing and had remained inactive for
some hours after the battle had begun at the
other end of the line, having finally received
orders from McClellan to cross the stone bridge,
since known as Burnside's Bridge, and drive the
Confederates out of their strong position. The
Confederates at this bridge were commanded by
General Toombs, who had orders from General
Lee to hold the bridge at all hazards. They
were behind strong breastworks and rifle pits,
which commanded the bridge with both a direct
and enfilading fire. General Robert Toombs had
been a former United States senator and a member
of Jefferson Davis' cabinet. Perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
most notable event of his life was the holding of
the Burnside Bridge at Antietam for three hours
against the fearful onslaughts of the Federals.
Burnside's chief officer at this time was General
Jacob D. Cox, afterwards governor of Ohio, who
succeeded General Reno, killed at South Mountain
or Boonsborough Gap. On General Cox
fell the task of capturing the stone bridge.</p>

<p>The Confederates had been weakened at this
point by the sending of Walker to the support
of Jackson, where, as we have noticed, he took
part in the deadly assault upon Sedgwick's
division.</p>

<p>Toombs, with his small force, had a hard task
of defending the bridge, notwithstanding his
advantage of position. McClellan sent several
urgent orders to General Burnside to cross the
bridge at all hazards. Burnside forwarded
these to Cox and in the fear that the latter would
not be able to carry the bridge by a direct front
attack, he sent General Rodman with a division
to cross the creek at a ford below. This was
accomplished after much difficulty. One assault
after another was made upon the bridge in rapid
succession, which was at length carried at the
cost of 500 men. Burnside charged up the hill
and drove the Confederates almost to Sharpsburg.
The fighting along the Sharpsburg road
might have resulted in the Confederates' disaster
and the capture of General Lee's headquarters
had it not been for the timely arrival
of A.&nbsp;P. Hill's division, which emerged out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
a cloud of dust on the Harper's Ferry road and
came upon the field at double quick, and, under
a heavy fire of artillery, charged upon Burnside's
columns and after severe fighting, in which General
Rodman was mortally wounded, drove the
Federals back almost to the bridge. The pursuit
was checked by the Federal artillery on the
eastern side of the stream. Darkness closed the
conflict.</p>

<p>Lee had counted on the arrival of A.&nbsp;P. Hill
in time to help hold the Federals in check at
the bridge, but he was late and came up just in
time to save the army from disastrous defeat.</p>

<p>With the gloom of that night ended the conflict
known as Antietam.</p>

<p>For fourteen hours more than 100,000 men,
with 500 pieces of artillery, had engaged in
Titanic conflict. As the battle's smoke rose and
cleared away the scene presented was one to
make the stoutest heart shudder. There lay upon
the ground, scattered for three miles over the
valleys and hills, and in the improvised hospitals,
more than 20,000 men.</p>

<p>Horace Greeley was probably right when he
said that this was the bloodiest day in American
history.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_MURFREESBORO" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_MURFREESBORO">THE BATTLE OF MURFREESBORO</a></h2>

<p>The fall months of 1862 had been spent by Generals
Bragg and Buell in racing across Kentucky,
each at the head of a large army. Buell
had saved Louisville from the hands of the Confederates,
while on the other hand Bragg had
succeeded in carrying away a large amount of
plunder and supplies for his army which he had
gathered from the country through which he
passed, and of which his army was in great need.</p>

<p>The authorities at Washington became impatient
with Buell on account of his permitting the
Confederate army to escape intact, and decided
to relieve him of the command of the army, which
was handed to General W.&nbsp;S. Rosecrans, who had
won considerable distinction by his victories at
Corinth and other engagements in the West.
The Union army was now designated as the
Army of the Cumberland.</p>

<p>Bragg was concentrating his army at Murfreesboro,
in central Tennessee, which was near Stone's
River, a tributary of the Cumberland River.</p>

<p>On the last days of December General Bragg
was advised of the Federals' advance from Nashville,
which is about thirty miles from Murfreesboro,
and he lost no time in taking position and
getting his army into well-drawn battle lines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
His left wing under General Hardee, the center
Polk, and his right wing under Breckenridge,
his cavalry division was commanded by Generals
Wheeler, Forrest and Morgan. His lines were
three miles in length. On December 30th the
Federals came up from Nashville and took position
directly opposite in a parallel line. The
Federal left was commanded by Thos. L. Crittenden,
whose brother was a commander in the Confederate
army, and were sons of a famous United
States senator from Kentucky. The Federal
center was in command of General George H.
Thomas, and the right wing under General McCook.
Rosecrans had under his command about
43,000 men, while the strength of the Confederates
was about 38,000.</p>

<p>The two armies bivouacked within musket
range of each other, and the camp-fires of each
were clearly seen by the other, as they shown
through the groves of trees.</p>

<p>It was plain to be seen that a deadly combat
would begin with the coming of the morning.</p>

<p>Rosecrans had planned to attack the Confederate
right under Breckinridge, while on the
other hand Bragg had planned to attack the
Federal left under McCook, and to seize the
Nashville turnpike and thereby cut off Rosecrans'
retreat. Neither, of course, knew of the other's
plan.</p>

<p>At the break of day, on December 31st, the
Confederate left moved forward in a magnificent
battle-line, about a mile in length and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
columns deep. At the same time the Confederate
artillery opened with their cannon. The
Federals were astonished at so fierce and sudden
a charge and were ill prepared. Before
McCook could arrange them several batteries
were overpowered and several heavy guns fell
into the hands of the Confederates. The Union
troops fell back in confusion and seemed to have
no power to check the impetuous charge of the
onrushing foe. Only one division, under General
Philip H. Sheridan, held its ground. Sill's
brigade of Sheridan's division drove the Confederates
in front of its back to their entrenchments,
but in this charge the brave commander
lost his life.</p>

<p>While the battle raged with tremendous fury
on the Union right, Rosecrans was three miles
away, throwing his left across the river. Hearing
the terrific roar of the cannon and rattle of
the musketry, he hastened to attack Breckinridge,
hoping to draw a portion of the Confederate
force away from the attack on his right.
Ere long the sound of battle was coming nearer,
and he rightly divined that his right wing was
being rapidly driven upon his center by the dashing
soldiers of the South. He ordered McCook
to dispute every inch of the ground; but McCook's
command was torn to pieces except the
division of Sheridan, which stood firm against
the overwhelming numbers, which stand attracted
the attention of the country and brought
military fame to Sheridan. He checked the onrushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
foe at the point of the bayonet, and
re-formed his lines under a heavy fire. Rosecrans
ordered up the reserves to the support of
the Union center and right. Here for two hours
longer the battle raged with unabated fury.
Three times the Confederate left and center were
thrown against the Union lines, but failed to
break them. At length it was discovered that
the ammunition was exhausted in Sheridan's
division and he withdrew in good order to a plain
near the Nashville road. The Confederates'
advance was checked by the division of Thomas.</p>

<p>It was now in the afternoon, and still the
battle raged in the woods and on the hills about
Murfreesboro.</p>

<p>The Federal right and center had been forced
back to Stone's River, while Bragg's right was
on the same stream close to the Federal line.</p>

<p>In the meantime Rosecrans had massed his
artillery on a hill overlooking the field. He had
also re-formed his broken lines, and had called
12,000 fresh troops from his left into action. The
battle re-opened with utmost fury, and the ranks
of both armies were torn with grape and canister
and bursting shells.</p>

<p>General Breckinridge brought all of his division
excepting one brigade into the action. They
had for some time been inactive and were refreshed
by a short rest. The Confederates now
began a vigorous attack upon the Federal columns,
but were swept by a raking artillery fire.
They rallied again to the attack, but their ranks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
were again swept by Rosecrans' artillery and
the assault was abandoned.</p>

<p>Darkness was now drawing over the scene of
battle, and the firing abated slowly and died
away. It had been a bloody day, the dead and
dying lay upon the field and in the hospitals in
great numbers, and with the awful gloom and
suffering of that night ended the first day's battle
at Murfreesboro.</p>

<p>The next day was the first of the new year, and
both armies remained inactive during the entire
day, except to quietly prepare to renew the conflict
on the morrow. The renewal of the battle
on January 2d was fully expected, but there was
but little fighting until late in the afternoon.
Rosecrans had sent General Van Cleve across the
river to occupy an elevation from which he could
shell the town of Murfreesboro.</p>

<p>Bragg sent Breckinridge to dislodge this division,
which he did with splendid effect. But
Breckinridge's men became exposed to the raking
fire of the Federal artillery across the stream
and retreated to a place of safety with a loss of
1,700 men killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The next day brought no further conflict. On
the night of January 3d General Bragg began
to move his army away to winter quarters at
Shelbyville.</p>

<p>Murfreesboro was one of the great battles of
the war, and, except at Antietam, had not thus
far been surpassed. The losses were about
13,000 to the Federals, and about 10,000 to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Confederates. Both sides claimed the victory&mdash;the
South because of Bragg's decided success on
the first day; the North because of Breckinridge's
fearful repulse on the last day's battle, and of
Bragg's retiring in the night and refusing to
fight again.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_FREDERICKSBURG" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_FREDERICKSBURG">THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG</a></h2>

<p>The silent city of military graves at Fredericksburg
is a memorial of one of the bloodiest battles
of the war. General McClellan failed to follow
up the retreating Southern army after the battle
of Antietam, and thereby lost favor with the
authorities at Washington, and was relieved of
the command of the army, which was handed to
General Ambrose E. Burnside, who took command
of the Army of the Potomac on November
9, 1862, and on the following day McClellan
took leave of his troops.</p>

<p>Burnside changed the whole plan of the campaign
and decided to move on Fredericksburg on
the Rappahannock River. His army moved forward
in three divisions, under Sumner, Hooker
and Franklin. They were delayed several days
in crossing the river, due to the failure of the
arrival of the pontoon bridges. A council of
war was held on the night of December 10th, in
which the officers were opposed to the plan of
battle, but Burnside was determined to carry out
his original plan immediately. After two days
of skirmishing with the Confederate sharpshooters
he succeeded in getting his army across the
river on the morning of December 13th.</p>

<p>General Lee had by this time entrenched his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
army on the hills surrounding Fredericksburg.
His line stretched for five miles along the range
of hills, surrounding the town on all sides save
the east, where the river flows. The strongest
position of the Confederates was on Marye's
Heights, in the rear of the town. Along the foot
of this hill was a stone wall about four feet high,
bounding the eastern side of the Telegraph road,
being depressed a few feet below the surface of
the stone wall, and thus it formed a breastwork
for the Confederate troops. Behind this wall a
strong Confederate force was concealed, while
higher up the hill in several ranks the main army
was posted. The right wing of the Confederate
army, consisting of about 30,000 men, commanded
by "Stonewall" Jackson, was posted on
an elevation near Hamilton's crossing of the
Fredericksburg and Potomac railroad. The left
wing was posted on Marye's Heights, and was
commanded by the redoubtable Longstreet. The
Southern forces numbered about 75,000 men.</p>

<p>The town proper and the adjoining valleys
had been occupied for two days by the Federal
troops, marching to and fro and making ready
for a decisive conflict, which required no
prophet to foretell was near at hand. Franklin's
division of 40,000 men was strengthened by a
part of Hooker's division and was ordered to
make the first attack on the Confederate right,
under Jackson. Sumner's division was also
reënforced from Hooker's division and was
formed for an assault against the Confederates,
posted on Marye's Heights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
From the position taken by the Confederate
forces their cannons and field artillery poured
shot and shell into the town of Fredericksburg.
Every house became a target, though deserted
except by a few venturesome riflemen. There
was scarcely a house that escaped. Ruined, battered
and bloody Fredericksburg three times
was a Federal hospital and its back yards became
little cemeteries.</p>

<p>All this magnificent battle formation had been
effected under cover of a dense fog, and when
it lifted on that fateful Saturday there was revealed
a scene of truly military grandeur. Concealed
by the curtain of nature, the Southern
army had entrenched itself most advantageously
upon the hills, and the Union force massed in
strength below, lay within cannon shot of their
foe. The Union army totaled 113,000 men.</p>

<div id="ip_64" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i071.jpg" width="600" height="257" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">BATTLEFIELD OF FIRST BULL RUN</div></div>

<p>When the fog lifted in the forenoon of December
13th, Franklin's division was revealed
in full strength marching and counter-marching
in preparation of the coming conflict. Officers
in new uniforms, thousands of bayonets gleaming
in the sunshine, champing steeds, rattling
gun-carriages whisking artillery into proper
range, formed a scene of magnificent grandeur,
which excited the admiration of all, even the Confederates.
This maneuver has been called the
grandest military scene of the war, yet after all
this show, Burnside's subordinate officers were
unanimous in their belief in the rashness of the
undertaking. It is said by historians that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Army of the Potomac never went down to battle
with less alacrity than on this day at Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>The advance began about the middle of the
forenoon on Jackson's right, which was made
by the divisions led by Generals Meade, Doubleday
and Gibbon, who endeavored to seize one
of the opposing heights on Jackson's extreme
right. The advance was made in three lines of
battle, which were guarded in front and on each
flank by Jackson, whose artillery swept the field
by both a front and an enfilading fire as the
attacking columns advanced. And as the divisions
approached within range Jackson's left
poured a deadly fire of musketry upon them,
which mowed down brave men in the Union
lines in swaths, leaving broad gaps where men
had stood.</p>

<p>On the Federal columns came, only to be
swept again and again by this murderous fire,
but were at length repulsed.</p>

<p>The Confederate lines were broken only once
by a part of Meade's division, which captured
a few flags and several prisoners. The lost
ground was soon recovered by the Confederates.
Some of the charges made by the Federals in
this engagement were heroic in the extreme. In
one advance knapsacks were unslung and bayonets
fixed; a brigade marched across a plowed
field and passed through broken lines of other
brigades, which were retiring in confusion from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the leaden storm. In every instance the Federals
were driven back in shattered columns.</p>

<p>The dead and wounded lay in heaps. Soldiers
were fleeing and officers were galloping to and
fro, urging their lines forward.</p>

<p>At length they received orders to retreat, and
in retiring from the field the destruction was
almost as great as during the assault. Most of
the wounded were brought from the field after
the engagement, but the dead were left where
they fell.</p>

<p>During this engagement General George D.
Bayard was mortally wounded by a shot that
had severed the sword-belt of a subordinate
officer who was standing by.</p>

<p>While Franklin's division was engaged with
the Confederate right, Sumner's division was
engaged in a terrific assault upon the works of
Marye's Heights, which was the stronghold of
the Confederate forces. Their position was
almost impregnable, consisting of earthworks,
wood and stone barricades, running along the
sunken road near the foot of the hill. The Federals
were not apprised of the sunken road nor
of the Confederate force concealed behind the
stone wall, under General Cobb. When the Federals
advanced up the road they were harassed
by shot and shell at every step, but came dashing
on in line notwithstanding the terrific fire
which poured upon them. The Irish brigade of
Hancock's division, under General Meagher,
made a wonderful charge, the Irish soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
moved steadily up the ridge until within a few
yards of the sunken road, from which the unexpected
fire mowed them down. When they returned
from the assault but 250 out of 1,200
men reported under arms from the field, and all
these were needed to care for their wounded comrades.
This brigade, as we will notice later,
distinguished itself at Gettysburg and other engagements.
It lost more men in killed and
wounded than any regiment that left the State
of New York. When returning to be mustered
out in 1865, it had only forty-seven men out of
950 that enlisted four years before on first
leaving for the front.</p>

<p>Sumner sent column after column against this
strong position, but they were repulsed with
great slaughter. The approach was completely
commanded by the Confederate batteries.</p>

<p>Not only was the Confederate fire disastrous
upon the approaching columns, but it also inflicted
great damage upon the masses of the
Federal army, and it is said that in front of
Marye's house, which was in the center where
the charge was made, the Federals fell three
deep in one of the bravest and bloodiest charges
of the war.</p>

<p>Six times did the Federals, raked by the
deadly fire of Washington's artillery, advance
to within 100 yards of the sunken road, only to
be driven back by the rapid fire of the Confederate
infantry concealed there. The Confederates'
effective and successful work in this battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
was not alone due to their strong position,
but also to the skill and generalship of the
leaders, and the courage and well-directed aim
of their cannoneers and infantry.</p>

<p>The whole plain was covered with men, the
living men running here and there, their broken
lines closing up and the wounded being carried
to the rear.</p>

<p>The point and method of attack made by Sumner
was anticipated by the Confederates, and
careful preparation had been made to meet it.</p>

<p>As the Federal columns advanced without
hurrah or battle-cry, their entire lines were swept
by a heavy artillery fire, which poured canister
and shell and solid shot into their ranks from the
front and on both sides with frightful results.
The ground was so thickly strewn with dead
bodies as seriously to impede the movements of
renewed attack. These repeated assaults in such
good order caused some fear on the part of General
Lee that they might eventually break his
lines, and he conveyed his anxiety to General
Longstreet, but his fears proved groundless.</p>

<p>General Cobb, who had so gallantly defended
the Confederate position at the sunken road,
against the onslaughts of the Federals, fell mortally
wounded and was carried from the field.</p>

<p>His command was handed to Kershaw, who
took his place in this desperate struggle. The
onrushing Federals fell almost in battalions; the
dead and wounded lay in heaps. Late in the
day the dead bodies, which had become frozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
from the extreme cold, were placed in front of
the soldiers as a protection to shield the living.</p>

<p>The steadiness of the Union troops and the
silent and determined heroism of the rank and
file in these repeated but hopeless assaults upon
the Confederate works were marvelous indeed,
and will go down in history as a monument to the
memory of those who were engaged in this terrible
conflict.</p>

<p>After these disastrous attempts to carry the
works of the Confederate left it was night; the
Federals had retired; hope was abandoned, and
it was seen that the day was lost for the Union
forces. The shattered Army of the Potomac
sought to gather and care for the wounded. The
beautiful Fredericksburg of a few days before
now had put on a different appearance. Ancestral
homes were turned into hospitals. The
charming drives and stately groves, and the
pleasure grounds of the colonial days, were not
filled with grand carriages and gay parties, but
with war horses, soldiers and other military
equipments, and had put on the gloom that follows
in the wake of a defeated army after a great
battle.</p>

<p>The plan of Burnside had ended in failure.
In his report of the battle to Washington he gave
reasons for the issue, and in a manly way took
the responsibility upon himself and most highly
commended his officers and men.</p>

<p>President Lincoln's verdict of this battle is
reverse to the unanimous opinions of the historians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
In his reply to Burnside's report of the
battle he says, "Although you were not successful,
the attempt was not an error, nor the failure
other than accident."</p>

<p>After the battle the wounded lay on the field
in their agony, exposed to the freezing cold for
forty-eight hours before they were cared for.
Many were burned by the long dead grass becoming
ignited by the cannon fire.</p>

<p>The scene witnessed was dreadful and heart-rending.
The Union loss was about 12,000, and
the Confederates less than half that number.
The Union army was withdrawn across the river
under the cover of darkness, and the battle of
Fredericksburg had passed into history.</p>

<p>Burnside, at his own request, was relieved of
the command of the Army of the Potomac, which
was handed to General Joseph Hooker.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_CHANCELLORSVILLE" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_CHANCELLORSVILLE">THE BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE</a></h2>

<p>After the battle of Fredericksburg the Union
army went into winter quarters at Falmouth,
only a few miles away, while the Confederates
took up their encampment for the winter at
Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>General Joseph Hooker, who was popularly
known as "Fighting Joe Hooker," had succeeded
General Burnside in command of the
Army of the Potomac, which numbered about
130,000 men, while that of the Confederates
numbered about 60,000.</p>

<p>Hooker conceived the idea to divide his army
and leave Sedgwick with about 40,000 men to
make a feint upon the Confederates, stationed
about Fredericksburg, and himself with the remainder
of the army to move around Lee's army
and take a position at Chancellorsville, a small
place in a wilderness country only a few miles
from Fredericksburg, and by doing this, take
Lee by surprise. These plans of Hooker have
been considered by war historians as being well
laid if they had been carried out. Lee was on
the alert, and had heard of Hooker's plans, and
was not to be caught in the trap. Lee, paying
little attention to Sedgwick, east of Fredericksburg,
had turned to face Hooker. By rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
night marches he met Hooker's army before it
reached its destination. His advance columns
were pushed back by the Federals, who succeeded
in taking the position which was assigned to
them, Meade on the left and Slocum on the right,
with adequate support in the rear. All was in
readiness and had favorable positions when, to
the amazement of all the officers, Hooker ordered
the whole army to fall back to the position
it had occupied the day before, thereby leaving
the advantage with Lee, who moved his forces
up to the positions which the Federals evacuated
and began feeling the Federal lines with some
cannonading during the evening of May 1st.</p>

<p>The Confederates were in extreme danger, having
one large army in their front and another
almost as large as theirs in their rear near Fredericksburg.
But Lee decided to make one great
and decisive blow at Hooker in front. During
the night of May 1st Lee held council with
"Stonewall" Jackson and accepted a plan laid
out by him for Jackson to take part of the army
and move around through the dense wood and
rough country and fall upon the right flank of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of May 2d the cannonading
began its death-song and the infantry was
brought into action. Before long Jackson began,
with a portion of the army, to move off the field,
and Hooker, observing this, believed that Lee's
army was in full retreat on Richmond. This
movement proved to be the undoing of Hooker's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
army, as Jackson was making for his right flank.
It was about five o'clock in the afternoon when
Jackson broke from the woods in a charge upon
the unsuspecting troops of Hooker's right which
was under Howard.</p>

<p>The approach of Jackson's forces was first intimated
to the Federals by the bending of shrubbery,
the stampede of rabbits and squirrels, and
the flocks of birds in wild flight from the woods.
First appeared a few skirmishers, then the rattling
of musketry and the incessant roar of
cannon. On the Confederates came in their impetuous
charge. The charge was so unexpected
and terrific that they carried everything before
them. The Federal lines were swept as by tidal
waves and rolled up like a scroll.</p>

<p>This crowning and final stroke of Jackson's
military genius was the result of his own carefully
worked-out plan, which had been approved
by Lee.</p>

<p>General Hooker was spending the evening at
his headquarters at the Chancellor House, rejoicing,
as he thought, that Jackson was in full
retreat and everything appeared to be going well.
Presently the roar of battle became louder and
louder on his right and an officer came up at full
speed to notify him that his right was being
fiercely attacked, was giving away, and would
soon be in utter rout. Hooker made haste to the
scene of battle and passed through brigade after
brigade of his forces in retreat and confusion.</p>

<p>He was successful in having Berry re-form his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
division and charge the Confederates with fixed
bayonets, which partly stopped the Confederates'
advance. This gave the Federal artillery a few
minutes to prepare itself for action. They finally
succeeded in stopping the Confederate advance.</p>

<p>The mighty turmoil was silenced as darkness
gathered. The two hostile forces were concealed
in the darkness watching each other. Finally,
at midnight, the order, "Forward!" was given
in subdued tones to Sickle's corps. They stealthily
advanced upon the Confederate position and
at heavy loss gained the position sought for.</p>

<p>Between Hooker's and Sedgwick's divisions of
the army stood the Confederate army flushed
with the victory of the day, immediately in front
of Sedgwick was Fredericksburg, beyond which
loomed Marye's Heights, strongly guarded by
Washington's artillery of the Confederates.
These Heights were the battleground of a few
months before when Burnside tried in vain to
drive the Confederates from their crest.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight Sedgwick began his
march against Marye's Heights that was fraught
with peril and death. At the foot of the slope
were the stone wall and the sunken road, which
was the battleground of a few months before in
the battle of Fredericksburg. The crest and
slopes bristled with Confederate cannon and
musket. Sedgwick made his attack directly
upon the stone wall in the face of a terrible storm
of artillery and musketry. The first assault
failed, but the second met with more success, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
they succeeded in driving the Confederates from
their strong position at the point of the bayonet
by their overwhelming numbers. Sedgwick
pushed on to attack Lee in the rear, but Lee was
aware of his advance and dispatched General
Early with a strong force to hold him in check
and thus prevent his juncture with Hooker's
army at Chancellorsville. Lee's army and that
of Hooker's had been engaged since early
morning in deadly combat.</p>

<p>While this engagement was at its height General
Hooker, while leaning against a pillar on
the porch of the Chancellor House, was stunned
and felled to the ground and for some time it
was thought that he was killed. This was done
by a cannon ball, which shattered the pillar
against which he was leaning. This injury incapacitated
Hooker from active service the balance
of the day and he gave orders for his army to
retire, which was reluctantly done by his subordinate
officers. When his columns began to retire
from the field the Confederates increased their
artillery fire, which played upon the retreating
columns in blue. This fire marked the doom
of the old Chancellor House, where Hooker had
headquarters. The brick walls were pierced
through by cannon balls and shells exploded in
the upper rooms, setting the building on fire.
Fragments of the demolished chimneys rained
down upon the wounded in the lower rooms.</p>

<p>During the entire day's battle there were
nineteen women and children, including some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
slaves, in the cellar where they had taken refuge.
They were all removed before the complete destruction
of the house by fire.</p>

<p>The long, deep trenches, full of Federal and
Confederate dead, told the awful story of Chancellorsville.
This scene will never be forgotten
by the survivors of the battle. This was one of
the greatest battles yet fought on the American
Continent, and has gone down in history as being
one of the greatest of modern times.</p>

<p>The Union loss was about 17,000, while that
of the Confederates was about 13,000.</p>

<p>Late in the evening of the first day's battle
General "Stonewall" Jackson was mortally
wounded, in which the South suffered incalculable
loss. After his brilliant flank march
and the evening attack on Hooker's army had
been driven home, at half-past eight, Jackson
had ridden beyond his lines to reconnoiter for
the final advance. By the sudden fire of musketry
in his front, he discovered that he was
within the enemy's lines. His party, suddenly
turning back and riding at full speed, was mistook
by his own men for the enemy, and his men,
firing a volley of musketry, killed and wounded
several of Jackson's party and mortally wounded
Jackson by two shots in the left arm and one
in his right hand. He was taken from his horse
by the officers who were with him, among whom
was A.&nbsp;P. Hill. It was found that there was
no immediate conveyance for him to be carried
within his lines. Presently the enemy discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the commotion and mistaking it as an advance
of the Confederate lines, began to shell
the immediate vicinity with grape and canister,
which necessitated the party with Jackson to lie
down to escape the shower of lead which poured
over them. The scene about them was an awful
one. The air was pierced by the shrieks of
shells and the cries of the wounded. Finally a
stretcher was secured and Jackson was carried
to the rear. One of the bearers was shot down
and his place was taken by another. During
the turmoil General W.&nbsp;D. Pender was met, who
expressed the fear that his lines must fall back.
General Jackson, in a clear voice, "You must
hold your ground, General Pender; you must
hold your ground to the last, sir." This was
his last order to a subordinate officer.</p>

<p>It was first thought that Jackson's wounds
would not prove fatal, but he developed pneumonia
and gradually grew worse, and on the
morning of May 10th it was apparent that he
had only a few hours to live; at times he
was unconscious and his mind apparently wandered
on previous battlefields. During one of
his unconscious moments he suddenly cried out,
"Order A.&nbsp;P. Hill to prepare for action. Pass
the infantry to the front!"</p>

<p>He then became silent and weak, and his last
words were: "Let us cross over the river and
rest in the shade of the trees."</p>

<p>When Lee heard that Jackson had fallen he
said: "Any victory would be dear at such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
price." It is thought by many that the result
at Gettysburg would have been different had
"The Great Flanker" lived to have been there.
Henderson, the British war historian, said the
fame of "Stonewall" Jackson is no longer the
exclusive property of Virginia and the South;
it has become the birthright of every man privileged
to call himself an American.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SIEGE_OF_VICKSBURG" id="THE_SIEGE_OF_VICKSBURG">THE SIEGE OF VICKSBURG</a></h2>

<p>Vicksburg, often called "The Gibraltar of the
West," is situated on the east bank of the Mississippi
River, where the river makes a great
bend and the east bank of the same makes up
from the river in a bluff about 200 feet.</p>

<p>Here at Vicksburg about 100,000 men and a
powerful fleet of many gunboats and ironclads
for forty days and nights fought to decide
whether the Confederate states should be cut in
twain; whether the great river should flow free
to the gulf.</p>

<p>The Confederate cannon, situated on the high
bluff along the river front at Vicksburg, commanded
the waterway for miles in either direction,
while the obstacles in the way of a land
approach were almost equally insurmountable.</p>

<p>The object of the Federal army was to gain
control of the entire course of the river that it
might, in the language of President Lincoln,
"Roll unvexed to the sea," and to separate the
Confederate states so as to hinder them from
getting supplies and men for their armies from
the southwest.</p>

<p>The great problem of the Federals was how
to get control of Vicksburg. This great question
was left to General Grant to work out.</p>

<p>In June, 1862, the Confederates, under General
Van Dorn, numbering 15,000 men, occupied
and fortified Vicksburg. Van Dorn was a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of great energy. In a short time he had hundreds
of men at work planting batteries, digging
rifle-pits, mounting heavy guns and building
bomb-proof magazines. All through the
summer the work progressed and by the coming
of winter the city was a veritable Gibraltar.</p>

<p>In the last days of June the combined fleet,
under Farragut and Porter, arrived below the
Confederate stronghold. They had on board
about 3,000 troops and a large supply of implements
required in digging trenches. The engineers
conceived the idea of cutting a new channel
for the Mississippi through a neck of land
on the Louisiana side opposite Vicksburg and
thereby change the course of the river and leave
Vicksburg high and dry.</p>

<p>While General Williams was engaged in the
task of diverting the mighty river across the
peninsula Farragut stormed the Confederate
batteries with his fleet, but failed to silence
Vicksburg's cannon guards. He then determined
to dash past the fortifications with his
fleet, trusting to the speed of his vessels and the
stoutness of their armor to survive the tremendous
cannonade that would fall upon them.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of June 28th his vessels
moved forward and after several hours of
terrific bombardment with the loss of three vessels,
passed through the raging inferno to the
waters above Vicksburg.</p>

<p>Williams and his men, including 1,000 negroes,
labored hard to complete the canal, but a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
rise in the river swept away the barriers
with a terrific roar and many days of labor went
for naught. This plan was at length abandoned
and they all returned with the fleet during the
last days of July to Baton Rouge, and Vicksburg
was no more molested until the next spring.</p>

<p>In October General John C. Pemberton, a
Philadelphian by birth, succeeded Van Dorn in
command of the Confederate forces at Vicksburg.
General Grant planned to divide the
army of the Tennessee, Sherman taking part of
it from Memphis down the Mississippi on transports
while he would move overland with the
rest of the army and coöperate with Sherman
before Vicksburg. But the whole plan proved a
failure, through the energies of Van Dorn and
others of the Confederate army in destroying
the Federal lines of communication.</p>

<p>Sherman, however, with an army of about
32,000 men, left Memphis on December 20th, and
landed a few days later some miles above Vicksburg,
and on the 29th made a daring attack on
the Confederate lines at Chickasaw Bayou, and
suffered a decisive repulse with a loss of 2,000
men.</p>

<p>Sherman now found the northern pathway to
Vicksburg impassable and withdrew his men to
the river, and, to make up triple disaster to the
Federals, General Nathan Forest, one of the
brilliant Confederate cavalry leaders, with 2,500
horsemen, dashed through the country west of
Grant's army, tore up many miles of railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
and destroyed all telegraph lines and thus cut
off all communication of the Federals.</p>

<p>In the meantime General Van Dorn pounced
upon Holly Springs, capturing the guard of
1,500 men and burning Grant's great store of
supplies, estimated to be worth a million and a
half dollars, thus leaving Grant without supplies,
and for many days without communication
with the outside world. It was not until about
the middle of January that he heard, through
Washington, of the defeat of Sherman at
Chickasaw Bayou.</p>

<p>Grant changed his plan of attack and decided
to move his army below Vicksburg and approach
the city from the south. Another plan was to
cut a channel through the peninsula opposite
Vicksburg and again try the project of changing
the bed of the Mississippi so as to leave
Vicksburg some miles inland. For six weeks
thousands of men worked on this ditch; early in
March the river began to rise and on the morning
of the 8th it broke through the embankments
and the men had to run for their lives. Many
horses were drowned and great numbers of implements
submerged. The "Father of waters"
had put a decisive veto on the project, and the
same was abandoned.</p>

<p>On the night of April 16th Porter ran past
the batteries of Vicksburg with his fleet after
days of preparation. They left their station
near the mouth of the Yazoo about nine o'clock.
Suddenly the flash of musketry fire pierced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
darkness. A storm of shot and shell was rained
upon the passing vessels. The water of the river
was lashed into foam by the shot and shell from
the batteries. The gunboats answered with their
cannon. The air was filled with flying missiles.
The transport, Henry Clay, caught fire and
burned to the water's edge. By three in the
morning the fleet was below the city and ready
to coöperate with Grant's army.</p>

<p>Grant's army at that time numbered about
43,000 men, and he decided to make a campaign
into the interior of Mississippi while waiting for
General Banks from Baton Rouge to join him.
The Confederate army under Pemberton numbered
about 40,000, and about 15,000 more Confederates
were at Jackson, Miss., under command
of General Joseph E. Johnston. It was
against Johnston's army that Grant decided to
move. Johnston, on being attacked by Grant,
fell back from Jackson and took a position on
Champion's Hill, where a hard battle was fought
in which the Confederates were greatly outnumbered
and gave way in confusion. Part of Pemberton's
army had arrived and was engaged in
this battle. Pemberton retreated towards Vicksburg,
closely followed by Grant, and several
short engagements between the two armies took
place on the road to Vicksburg. The Federal
army now invested the city, occupying the surrounding
hills. Around the doomed city
gleamed the thousands of bayonets of the Union
army. The city was filled with soldiers and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
citizens of the country who had fled there for
refuge and were now penned in.</p>

<p>On May 22d Grant ordered a grand assault
by his whole army. The troops, flushed with
their victories of the last few days, were eager
for the attack. It is said that his columns were
made up with his taller soldiers in front and
the second in stature in the next line, and so
on down, so as to save exposure to the fire of the
enemy.</p>

<p>At the appointed time the order was passed
down the line to move forward, and the columns
leaped from their hiding places and started on
their disastrous march in the face of a murderous
fire from the defenders of the city, only
to be mowed down by the sweeping fire from
the Confederate batteries. Others came, crawling
over the bodies of their fallen comrades, but at
every charge they were met by the missiles of
death. Thus it continued hour after hour until
the coming of darkness. The assault had failed
and the Union forces retired within their entrenchments
before the city. This is considered
as one of the most brave and disastrous
assaults of the war.</p>

<p>The army now settled down to the wearisome
siege, and for six weeks they encircled the city
with trenches, approaching nearer and nearer
to the defending walls. One by one the defending
batteries were silenced. On the afternoon
of June 25th a redoubt of the Confederate
works was blown up with a mine. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
same exploded the Federals began to dash into
the opening, only to meet with a withering fire
from an interior parapet which the Confederates
had constructed in the anticipation of this event.</p>

<p>Grant was constantly receiving reënforcements,
and before the end of the siege his army
numbered 70,000.</p>

<p>Day and night the roar of artillery continued
without ceasing. Shrieking shells from Porter's
fleet rose in grand curves, either bursting in
midair or on the streets of the city, spreading
havoc in all directions.</p>

<p>The people of the city burrowed into the
ground for safety, their walls of clay being
shaken by the roaring battles that raged above
the ground. The supply of food became scarcer
day by day, and by the end of June the entire
city was in a complete famine. They had been
living for several days upon corn meal, beans
and mule meat, and were now facing their last
enemy, death by starvation.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock on the morning of July 3d the
firing ceased and a strange quietness rested over
all. Pemberton had opened negotiations with
Grant for the capitulation of the city. It is
strange to say that on this very day the final
chapter at Gettysburg was being written.</p>

<p>On the following morning Pemberton marched
his 30,000 men out of the city and surrendered
them as prisoners of war. They were released
on parole.</p>

<p>This was the largest army ever surrendered
at one time.</p>

<h2><a name="BATTLE_OF_GETTYSBURG" id="BATTLE_OF_GETTYSBURG">BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG</a></h2>

<p>Our colonial fathers from North and South
fought together when they brought this republic
into being, defended it together in the war of
1812, and triumphed together when they carried
the Stars and Stripes into the heritage of
the Montezumas. The final and crucial test of
the republic's strength and durability was the
combat on the field of battle in the war between
the states. The battle of Gettysburg is conceded
to be the turning point in that war. Abraham
Lincoln said in his Gettysburg address, in November,
1863: "This nation, conceived in
liberty and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal, is now engaged in a
great civil war, testing whether this nation, or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can
long endure."</p>

<p>The great question of that day was the question
of state rights and relationship between
state and federal government.</p>

<p>It had now come to the point where it could
not be determined in the councils of peace, although
the illustrious Henry Clay and other
statesmen of his day had been the means of successfully
deferring from time to time this crisis
for almost a half century.</p>

<p>Gettysburg is a small, quiet town among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
hills of Adams county, in southeastern Pennsylvania,
and in 1863 contained about 1,500 inhabitants.
It had been founded by James
Gettys in about 1780. He probably never
dreamed that his name, thus given to the village,
would become famous in history for all time.</p>

<p>The hills around Gettysburg are little more
than general swells of ground, and many of
them were covered with timber when the legions
of the North and South fought out the destinies
of the republic on those memorable July days in
1863.</p>

<p>Lee's army was flushed with the victories of
Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, and public
opinion was demanding an invasion of the North.</p>

<p>Lee crossed the Potomac early in June, after
leaving General Stuart with his cavalry and a
part of Hill's corps to prevent Hooker from pursuing.
He began to concentrate his army around
Hagerstown, Md., and prepare for a campaign
in Pennsylvania. His army was organized into
three corps under the respective commands of
Longstreet, Ewell and A.&nbsp;P. Hill. Lee had
driven his army so as to enter Pennsylvania by
different routes, and to assess the towns along
the way with large sums of money. In the latter
part of June Lee was startled by the information
that Stuart had failed to detain Hooker,
and that the Federals were in hot pursuit. He
soon conceived that the two armies must soon
come together in a mighty death struggle, which
meant that a great battle must be fought, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
greater battle than this western world has heretofore
known, which is claimed by historians as
being one of the decisive battles of the world.</p>

<p>The Army of the Potomac had changed leaders,
and George Gordon Meade was now its commander,
having succeeded Hooker on June 28th.
Thus for the third time the Army of the Potomac
in ten months had a new commander.</p>

<p>The two great armies were scattered over portions
of Maryland and southern Pennsylvania.
Both were marching northward along parallel
lines, the Federals endeavoring to stay between
Lee's army and Washington. It was plain that
they must soon come together in a gigantic conflict;
but just where the shock of battle was to
take place was yet unknown.</p>

<p>Meade sent General Buford in advance with
4,000 cavalry to intercept the Confederate
advance guard.</p>

<p>On the night of June 30th Buford encamped
on a hill a mile west from Gettysburg, and here
on the following morning the great battle had its
beginning.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 1st the two armies
were still well scattered, the extremes forty
miles apart. General Reynolds, with two corps
of the Union army was but a few miles away
and was hastening to Gettysburg, while Longstreet
and Hill were approaching from the west,
with Hill's corps several miles in advance.</p>

<p>Buford opened battle against the advance division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of Hill's corps under General Heth. Reynolds
soon joined and the first day's battle was
now in full progress. General Reynolds, while
placing his troops in line of battle early in the
day, received a death shot in the head by a Confederate
sharpshooter. This was a great loss to
the Federals, as he was one of the bravest and
most able generals in the Union army. No
casualty of the war brought more widespread
mourning to the North than the death of General
John F. Reynolds. But even this calamity
did not stay the fury of the battle.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon the Federals were
heavily reënforced, and A.&nbsp;P. Hill had arrived
on the field with the balance of his corps, and
the roar of battle was unceasing. About the
middle of the afternoon a breeze lifted the
smoke from the field and revealed that the
Federals were falling back towards Gettysburg.
They were hard pressed by the Confederates
and were pushed back through the town with
the loss of many prisoners. The Federals took
a position on Cemetery Hill and the first day's
battle was over.</p>

<p>If the Confederates had known the disorganized
condition of the Federal troops, they might
have pursued and captured a large part of the
army.</p>

<p>It is thought by many that if "Stonewall"
Jackson had lived to be there that at this particular
time is where he would have delivered
his crushing blow to the Federals and no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
would have changed the final result of the battle.
Meade was still some miles from the field, but
on hearing of the death of Reynolds sent General
Hancock to take command until he himself
should arrive.</p>

<p>The Union loss on the first day was severe. A
great commander had fallen and they had suffered
the fearful loss of 10,000 men.</p>

<p>Hancock arrived late in the afternoon, after
riding at full speed. His presence brought an
air of confidence, and his promise of heavy
reënforcements all tended to inspire renewed
hope in the ranks of the discouraged army.</p>

<p>Meade reached the scene late at night and
chose to make this field the place of a general
engagement. Lee had come to the same decision,
and both called on their outlying legions to
make all possible speed to Gettysburg. The
night was spent in the marshaling of troops, getting
position, planting artillery, and bands playing
at intervals on the arrival of new divisions
on the field.</p>

<p>General Gordon says that during the night the
sound of axes and the falling of trees in the
Federal entrenchments could plainly be heard,
and that he became convinced during the night
that by morning they would be so well fortified
on Cemetery Hill that their position would be
almost impregnable, and that he succeeded in
getting a council of officers during the night to
take under advisement a night attack on the
enemy, but was told that General Lee had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
orders that no further attack should be made
until Longstreet arrived, and he had not yet
arrived.</p>

<p>The dawn of July 2d broke into a beautiful
summer day. Both armies hesitated to begin
the battle and remained inactive until in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>The fighting on that day was confined chiefly
to the two extremes, leaving the center inactive.
Longstreet commanded the Confederate right
and the Union left was commanded by General
Daniel E. Sickles, whose division lay directly
opposite that of Longstreet. The Confederate
left was commanded by General Richard Ewell,
who succeeded to the command of this division
after the death of "Stonewall" Jackson at Chancellorsville.
While the Federal right, stationed
on Culp's Hill was commanded by General
Slocum.</p>

<p>Between these armies was a hollow into which
the anxious farmers had driven and penned
large numbers of cattle, which they thought
would be a place of safety, and could not conceive
that any battle could affect this place of
refuge, but when the battle began and the stream
of shells was directed against Round Top this
place of refuge became a raging inferno of
bursting shells.</p>

<p>There was a gate at the entrance of the local
cemetery at Gettysburg that had written on it
this sign: "All persons found using firearms
in these grounds will be prosecuted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
utmost rigor of the law." Many a soldier must
have smiled at these words, for this gateway became
the very center of the crudest use of firearms
yet seen on this "terrestrial ball."</p>

<p>The plan of General Meade was to have General
Sickles connect his division with that of
Hancock and extend southward near the base of
the Round Tops. Sickles found this ground, in
his opinion, low and disadvantageous and advanced
his division to higher ground in front,
placing his men along the Emmettsburg road
and back toward the Trostle farm and the wheat-field,
thus forming an angle at the peach orchard,
thus leaving this division alone in its position
far in advance of the other Federal lines. This
position taken by Sickles was in disobedience of
orders from General Meade, and was considered
by Meade, as well as President Lincoln, as being
a great mistake, but General Sickles always
maintained that he did right, and that his position
was well taken.</p>

<p>Longstreet was quick to see this apparent mistake
and marched his troops along Sickles' front
entirely overlapping the left wing of the Union
army. Lee gave orders to Longstreet to make
a general attack, and the boom of his cannon
announced the beginning of the second day's
battle. The Union forces answered quickly with
their batteries and the fight extended from the
peach orchard along the whole line to the base
of Little Round Top. The musketry opened all
along the line until there was one continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
roar. Longstreet swept forward in a line or
battle a mile and a half long. He pressed back
the Union forces and for a time it looked as
though the Federals would be routed in utter
confusion.</p>

<p>At the extreme left, near the Trostle house,
was stationed John Biglow, in command of a
Massachusetts battery, with orders to hold his
position at all hazards. He defended his position
well, but was finally routed with great loss
by overwhelming numbers. This attack was
made by Longstreet again and again, and was
one of the bloodiest spots on the field at Gettysburg.</p>

<p>The most desperate struggle of the day was
to get possession of Little Round Top, which was
the key to the whole battleground west and
south of Cemetery Ridge. General Longstreet
sent General Hood with his division to occupy it.
The Federals, under General Warren, defended
this position and were charged on by General
Hood's division with fixed bayonets time after
time, which finally became a hand-to-hand conflict,
but the Confederates were pressed down
the hillside at the point of the bayonet, and thus
was ended one of the most severe hand-to-hand
conflicts yet known.</p>

<p>Little Round Top was saved to the Union
army, but the cost was appalling. The hill was
covered with hundreds of the slain. Many of
the Confederate sharpshooters had taken position
among the crevasses of the rocks in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Devil's Den, where they could overlook the position
on Little Round Top, and their unerring
aim spread death among the Federal officers.
General Weed was mortally wounded, and, as
General Hazlett was stooping to receive his last
message, a sharpshooter's bullet laid him dead
across the body of his chief.</p>

<p>During this attack, and for some time thereafter,
the battle continued in the valley below,
where many thousands were engaged. Longstreet
and Sickles were engaged in a determined
conflict, and it was apparent to all engaged that
a decisive battle was being fought, and they
were making a determined effort. Sickles' line
was being pressed back to the base of the hill.
His leg was shattered by a bursting shell, while
scores of his officers and thousands of his men
lay on the field to dream of battlefields no more.
The coming of darkness ended the struggle.
This valley has been rightly called the "Valley
of Death."</p>

<p>While this battle was going on in this part of
the field another was being fought at the other
extreme end of the lines. General Ewell was
making an attack on Cemetery Hill and Culp's
Hill, held by Slocum, who had been weakened
by the sending of a large portion of his corps
to the assistance of General Sickles. Ewell had
three divisions, two of which were commanded
by Generals Early and Johnston. Early made
the attack on Cemetery Hill, but was repulsed
after a bloody and desperate hand-to-hand fight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Johnston's attack on Culp's Hill was more successful,
but was at length repulsed after the
Federals had been heavily reënforced.</p>

<p>Thus closed the second day's battle of Gettysburg.
The harvest of death had been great.
The Federal loss during the two days was about
20,000 men; the Confederate loss was nearly as
great. The Confederates had gained an apparent
advantage on Culp's Hill, but the Union
lines, except as to this point, were unbroken.</p>

<p>On the night of July 2d Lee held council of
war with his generals and decided to make a
grand assault on Meade's center the following
day. Against this decision Longstreet protested
in vain, but Lee was encouraged by the arrival
of Pickett's division and Stuart's cavalry, which
had not yet been engaged. Meade had held
council with his officers, and had come to a like
decision to defend.</p>

<p>That night a brilliant July moon shed its
luster upon the ghastly field, over which thousands
of men lay unable to rise. With many
their last battle was over, but there were great
numbers of wounded who were calling for the
kindly touch of a helping hand. Nor did they
call wholly in vain. They were carried to the
improvised hospitals where they were given attention.
The dead were buried in unknown
graves soon to be forgotten except by their
loving mothers.</p>

<p>All through the night the Confederates were
massing their artillery along Seminary Ridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
The disabled horses were being replaced by
others. The ammunition was being replenished,
and all was being made ready for their work of
destruction on the morrow.</p>

<p>The Federals were diligently laboring in the
moonlight arranging their batteries on Cemetery
Hill. The coming of morning revealed the two
parallel lines of cannon which signified too well
the story of what the day would bring forth.</p>

<p>On the first day of July, 1863, Pickett's division
was encamped near Chambersburg, Penn.,
about twenty miles from Gettysburg.</p>

<p>This division was composed of three brigades,
commanded by Armistead, Garnett and Kemper.
They had no intimation that they would be called
on to take part in the battle that was going on
at Gettysburg. They had been following up as
the rear guard of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<div id="ip_96" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i105.jpg" width="600" height="414" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">BATTLE OF ANTIETAM</div></div>

<p>The men were quietly sleeping after a most
fatiguing march, and many no doubt dreaming
of their homes along the Atlantic and Chesapeake,
and others of their beautiful mountains
and beautiful valleys, and in their dreams, perhaps,
felt the warm kiss of their loved ones. All
at once the long roll was sounded, and these
visions vanished as they awoke and realized that
grim war was still rampant. The division was
ordered, about 1 <span class="smcap smaller">A.&nbsp;M.</span> on the morning of
July 2d, to pack up and make ready to march,
and while doing this it was rumored along the
lines that Hood's division of Texans had been
repulsed in charging Cemetery Heights at Gettysburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
with frightful loss, and that it was the
intention of General Lee that their division
should charge the strong position as a forlorn
hope.</p>

<p>About 3 <span class="smcap smaller">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, on July 2d, the division
began to move towards Gettysburg and marched
as rapidly as circumstances would permit, as the
roads were blocked with wagons, artillery, and
the wounded of both armies. At length it arrived
at about two o'clock in the evening within
two miles of Gettysburg and immediately went
into camp. While they were doing so a courier
rode up and informed the officers that McLaws'
division of Georgians had just made a charge
on Cemetery Heights and had been repulsed with
great slaughter. This division, together with
Hood's and Pickett's, made up Longstreet's
corps, and it seemed that each of his divisions
was to have the honor of making an assault on
Cemetery Heights. General Pickett now informed
his men that he had orders to hurl his
division against this position on the next day
unless the artillery should succeed in dislodging
the enemy.</p>

<p>On the following day this division took position
in line of battle directly behind the Confederate
artillery line on Seminary Ridge, with
a line of timber between, and had orders to lie
down. General Lee had massed in front of the
division about 120 pieces of artillery, and they
were to open on Cemetery Heights and endeavor
if possible to dislodge the enemy. This cannonading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
began about noon, and was answered
by the enemy with a hundred pieces. A more terrific
fire has never been witnessed by man than
occurred there on that July afternoon. The
earth was shaken by its roar, such as probably
the younger Pliny mentioned in his description
of the eruption of Vesuvius when Pompeii and
Herculaneum were destroyed. The sky was
black with smoke, and livid with the flame belching
from the mouth of the cannon.</p>

<p>During all this cannonading Pickett's division
was lying awaiting it to cease. Round shot
whistled through the trees, shells burst over their
heads, dealing destruction within their ranks.
The shot and shell from their enemy's guns
that passed over the artillery invariably fell in
the ranks of Pickett's division, which seemed
doomed to destruction without even the opportunity
of firing a gun. While this cannonading
was going on, General Armistead and the other
brigade commanders passed along in front of
their respective commands informing their men
that unless the artillery succeeded in dislodging
the enemy from Cemetery Heights, they were to
charge this position. Although this had been
tried by the respective divisions of McLaw and
Hood, and in each instance had been repulsed
with great slaughter, yet they seemed determined
to win for Virginia and the Confederate states
a name which would be handed down to posterity
in honor, and which would be spoken of in pride
by not only Virginia but by all America. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
this particular they succeeded, for not only have
their foes accorded them a crown of laurels, but
England spoke words of praise for these men,
whose Anglo-Saxon blood nerved them to such
a deed.</p>

<p>All at once the terrible cannonading ceased,
and the stillness of death prevailed. General
Pickett rode along the line informing his men
that the artillery had not succeeded in driving
the enemy from their strong position. Word
was passed down the line from the right that they
were to charge. All were on their feet in a
moment and ready; not a sound was heard; not
a shot was fired from any part of the field. The
command, "Forward!" was given, and in five
minutes they had passed through the strip of
woods that lay between them and the artillery,
and as they emerged from the cover and passed
through the artillery line the artillerymen
raised their hats and cheered them on their way.
They also passed through Lane's brigade of Wilcox's
division, whose men were waiting for orders
to support the charge. General Garnett
was leading the center, General Kemper on the
right, and General Armistead was leading the
left of the division with a swarm of skirmishers
in front. The smoke had cleared away and revealed
the long line of the Federal position on
Cemetery Heights, which was about a mile distant.</p>

<p>When the Federals observed the advance of
Pickett's division, which they had anticipated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
they opened fire, which at first ranged over the
advancing columns, but before they had marched
half the distance they began to get range on
them. The Confederate lines advanced steadily
and in full confidence. A band on the extreme
right continued to play "Dixie," "The Girl I
Left Behind Me," and other familiar airs of
the day. The division was marching directly
towards Hancock's position, this objective point
having been given Pickett by General Lee, but
after passing through Wilcox's division in waiting
Pickett caused each of his three brigades to
make a half-wheel to the left. This, being well
executed, was attended with some loss of time.</p>

<p>The Federal artillery soon began its death
work of destruction. Pickett's division had
been quite near this grim monster before, but on
this occasion he seemed to be pressing on them
steadily and closely, which was enough to make
the bravest quail under his ghastly appearance.
The Federals seem to have exhausted their ammunition
in some places in the artillery lines. This
being discovered by Pickett, gave him courage,
and he caused his division to move up quickly.
Crossing several fields inclosed by strong fences,
he at length reached the base of the elevation.
He once more changed his direction by a half-wheel
to the right, halting to rectify his lines.
His division pushed on, but great gaps were being
cut in his lines by the grape and canister
from the Federal artillery, causing such wide
openings that the division had to be halted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
dressed first to the right and then to the left,
obliquing and filling up the lines. They were
now in close range of the Federal lines and were
being fired upon from behind a stone wall, and
their ranks were fast melting away.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Death was upon every breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lurked in every flower."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The division pressed on. Round shot, shell,
canister and rifle balls were poured into them at
close range from the front, and a battery on
Round Top raked the line from the right.</p>

<p>Pickett was expecting to be supported by Pettigrew's
brigade on the left, and Lane's brigade
on the right. Those brigades, however, were
coming up, but were being met by such strong
opposition that they were entirely outdistanced
and fell back finally with Pickett's retreat,
thus leaving Pickett with his three brigades
alone in front. The Confederate ranks were
thinning as far as eye could see. Garnett was
killed leading his brigade, his being in the lead.
Kemper, coming up next to the distance of sixty
yards behind, brought his brigade to a halt to
give Armistead time to come up for the last and
final charge.</p>

<p>They were fired upon by the enemy, posted
along the edge of the woods. This murderous
fire almost disorganized them. Armistead, urging
his men forward with his hat on his sword,
holding it up as a guide, crossed over the Union
breastworks, and for a time the Confederates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
seemed to gain some advantage, but were presently
surrounded by overwhelming numbers.
General Armistead was mortally wounded, and
nearly all the other officers of the division were
either killed or wounded.</p>

<p>Pickett, seeing the hopelessness of the charge,
ordered a retreat of his shattered lines.</p>

<p>Out of 4,800 men that followed Pickett,
scarcely 1,200 to 1,300 got back into the Confederate
lines. Out of eighteen field officers and
four generals, Pickett and one lieutenant colonel
alone remained unharmed.</p>

<p>Pickett's division, together with the supporting
brigades under Lane and Pettigrew, numbered
about 14,000 men. Where General Armistead
fell is considered to be the highest point,
figuratively speaking, that was reached by the
Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>Pickett's charge will be remembered by all
future Americans as the English remember that
of the Light Brigade, and the French that of the
old guard under Marshal Ney at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The battle of Gettysburg was now over. The
loss was about 50,000 men, which was about
equally divided between the two armies.</p>

<p>General Lee decided to lead his army back to
Virginia. The Confederates were much discouraged,
for on this same day Vicksburg had
been surrendered to General Grant.</p>

<p>All through the night of July 3d Lee's army
was making ready to march and at the break of
day A.&nbsp;P. Hill swung his corps into line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
march through a downpour of rain. The next
to follow was Longstreet's corps, which followed
close upon A.&nbsp;P. Hill, and the last to leave was
Ewell's corps, and the retreat was covered by
Stuart's cavalry.</p>

<p>General Hood had with him 4,000 prisoners.
The wounded were carried with the retreat in
wagons and other ways of conveyance, and were
under the charge of General Imboden.</p>

<h2><a name="BATTLE_OF_CHICKAMAUGA" id="BATTLE_OF_CHICKAMAUGA">BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA</a></h2>

<p>This battle derives its name from Chickamauga
Creek, which is but a few miles from Chattanooga,
Tenn., and is considered one of the
greatest battles of modern times. It was exceeded
in our Civil war only by Gettysburg and
the Wilderness; compares with Waterloo, and
twice bloodier than Wagram or Austerlitz.
General D.&nbsp;H. Hill said that he had never seen
the Federal dead lie so thickly on the ground
save in front of the sunken wall at Fredericksburg.
The late General John B. Gordon, whose
pen was never weary of writing the praises of
the Confederate soldiers, said that in his opinion
the battle of Chickamauga was even greater
than that of Gettysburg, but it is thought that
he was somewhat partial to Chickamauga, having
been reared there, and when a boy fished in
Chickamauga Creek, and had ridden behind his
father over the country which was later made
a great battlefield.</p>

<p>General Braxton Bragg was in command of
the Confederate army, known as the Army of
the Tennessee, which was concentrated around
Chattanooga.</p>

<p>General Rosecrans was in command of the
Federal army, known as the Army of the Cumberland.
It was made up of three corps under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Generals Crittenden, Thomas and McCook.
They began to advance on Chattanooga and endanger
Bragg's line of communication.</p>

<p>On September 8th Bragg abandoned Chattanooga
and fell back toward Rome, Ga. The
Federals took possession of the city of Chattanooga.
Rosecrans, believing that Bragg was in
full retreat, ordered Crittenden to pursue.
Meanwhile Bragg was concentrating his forces
near Lafayette, about twenty-five miles from
Chattanooga. He was joined by Generals S.&nbsp;B.
Buckner and Breckinridge. General Longstreet
was hastening from Virginia with about 12,000
men from Lee's army to join him, the men being
fresh from the field of Gettysburg.</p>

<p>Rosecrans' army was somewhat divided, as he
was not expecting a general battle. Bragg was
quick to grasp this opportunity of making a general
assault on the Union forces while they were
divided. The attack was made on the 13th of
September by General Polk, but from some misapprehension
of orders he did not move in time,
and thus gave Rosecrans time to unite his forces,
thus losing Bragg this opportunity of breaking
up the Army of the Cumberland.</p>

<p>The Federal forces under Crittenden now took
position at Gordon's Mills, on the left bank of
Chickamauga Creek, and the remainder of their
troops were within supporting distance, and
were under the command of Thomas and McCook,
the total Union strength being estimated
at about 60,000 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
The Confederate army lay on the east side of
the stream, and was under the immediate command
of Generals Polk, D.&nbsp;H. Hill and Buckner.</p>

<p>On the 18th Longstreet arrived with his troops.
Thus the two mighty armies were now face to
face.</p>

<p>Bragg endeavored to flank the Federal left
and thus intervene between it and Chattanooga,
and on the morning of September 19th the Confederates,
under General Polk, made a grand
assault upon the Federal left, under General
Thomas. Meanwhile the Federal right was being
heavily pressed by General Hood, commanding
Longstreet's corps. This was kept up the
entire day and when darkness came the Federals
had been forced back from the creek, but the
result was indecisive.</p>

<p>During the night preparations were made for
the renewal of the battle on the next morning,
which was Sunday, September 20th.</p>

<p>It is strange to say that some of the greatest
battles of the war were fought on Sunday.</p>

<p>General Longstreet now took command of his
troops which had arrived, but part of his corps
did not arrive in time for the battle, having been
delayed on trains that were behind time. This
brought their strength up to equal that of the
Federals.</p>

<p>General Thomas had taken position on Snodgrass
Hill, and was anticipating a Confederate
attack, which was made late in the morning by
General Polk, who was supported by Generals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Breckinridge and Patrick Cleburne, the last-named
being an Irishman formerly from the
County of Cork.</p>

<p>This assault was made time after time with
desperate loss to both sides. At length, by some
misunderstanding of orders, one of the Federal
divisions under General Wood withdrew from
its position. By this movement a large opening
was made in the center of their battle line.</p>

<p>This was quickly taken advantage of by three
divisions of the Confederates, which rushed in
with an impetus that was irresistible.</p>

<p>General Hood, one of the Confederate division
commanders, was severely wounded in this movement
with a minie ball, and was carried from the
field.</p>

<p>The Federals under Wood, Sheridan and Van
Cleve were driven from the field. General Longstreet
now assumed chief command, and here
gave a fine exhibition of his military genius. He
succeeded in separating the two wings of the
opposing army. The right wing already being
in full retreat, he wheeled and compelled the
further withdrawal of Federal troops in order to
save being surrounded. The retreating Federals
fled in confusion toward Chattanooga, after suffering
the loss of several thousand prisoners and
forty pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>The Confederates now concentrated their attack
upon Thomas, who had taken position on
a ridge. They were led by the indomitable Longstreet,
but were repulsed and hurled back with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
fearful slaughter. The Confederates were endeavoring
to flank Thomas' division by sending
Hinzman to the left and Kershaw with his divisions
to get in the rear. The fighting grew
fiercer and at intervals was hand-to-hand, and
continued the entire afternoon.</p>

<p>This attack on Thomas is considered one of the
heaviest made on a single point during the war.
General Thomas, in his stand at Chickamauga,
won for himself the name "The Rock of Chickamauga."
He was one of the bravest and most
able generals in the Union army, being a Virginian
by birth.</p>

<p>Under the cover of darkness Thomas withdrew
his army in good order to Rossville, and the following
day joined Rosecrans in Chattanooga.</p>

<p>This battle is generally considered a Confederate
victory, but left the Federal army in possession
of Chattanooga. The personal daring
and courage displayed in the ranks of both
armies has never been excelled on any battlefield.</p>

<p>The total loss exceeded 30,000 men, which was
probably divided about equal.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_LOOKOUT_MOUNTAIN_AND_MISSIONARY_RIDGE" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_LOOKOUT_MOUNTAIN_AND_MISSIONARY_RIDGE">THE BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN AND MISSIONARY RIDGE</a></h2>

<p>After the battle of Chickamauga, Rosecrans'
army was cooped up in Chattanooga, and his
sources of supplies were entirely cut off by Bragg,
except from the north of Chattanooga, by which
he received his supplies over mountainous wagon
roads, and, on account of heavy rains which fell
during October, the roads became almost impassable.
These trains were attacked by Confederate
cavalry under General Forest, and in one
day 300 wagons were destroyed and about 1,800
mules were either killed or captured. One
soldier said "the mud was so deep that we could
not travel by the road, but we got along pretty
well by stepping from mule to mule as they lay
dead by the way." Starvation threatened the
camp, and the army must be relieved.</p>

<p>Vigorous measures were now taken. General
Grant was now made commander of the western
armies. He had about 80,000 men in addition
to Burnside's force at Knoxville. The Confederates
had about 60,000. General Sherman was
directed to reënforce Grant at Chattanooga from
Vicksburg and transported his forces by boat to
Memphis, and from there marched overland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
The authorities at Washington also determined
to reënforce Rosecrans from the Army of the
Potomac, and 23,000 men, under General Hooker,
were transported by rail to Chattanooga. This
brought the Army of the Cumberland to numbers
far exceeding those of the Confederates.
The immediate command of all the Federal
forces was given to General Thomas until such
time as General Grant should arrive. Grant
telegraphed to Thomas to hold Chattanooga at
all hazards. Thomas replied, "I will do so till
we starve."</p>

<p>The first and great question of the Federals
was to relieve their line of supplies. General
Hooker was sent with a portion of his troops
against a strong position taken by some Confederates
in Lookout Valley, and, after a short
but decisive battle succeeded in driving the Confederates
back, which left him in possession of
the immediate country, and thus opened up a
route to Brown's Ferry, over which a route for
abundant supplies was at once available. This
relieved the Army of the Cumberland of its
perilous position.</p>

<p>Thomas was being reënforced from all sides;
Hooker was already on the ground; Sherman was
advancing rapidly from Memphis, while Burnside's
forces at Knoxville offered protection for
the left flank of the Federal army.</p>

<p>General Bragg had his forces in a line extending
a distance of twelve miles across to Missionary
Ridge, and was strengthened by entrenchments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
throughout the lowlands. He determined
to attack Burnside at Knoxville, and dispatched
Longstreet over his protest with 20,000 men to
do this, thus weakening his extended lines. This
has been considered a very great mistake of
Bragg, as his total force was much less than had
opposed Rosecrans at Chickamauga. Grant had
now arrived and had assumed command of the
entire Federal forces, and had planned to attack
Bragg on November 24th, but on receiving information,
which proved to be unreliable, that Bragg
was preparing to retreat, he decided to make the
attack on the 23d, and ordered Thomas to advance
upon Bragg's center. This attack took the
Confederates by surprise. After some severe
fighting, they fell back more than a mile and
left the Federals in command of some advantageous
positions, thus ending the first day's
battle.</p>

<p>Preparations were made during the night for
a general engagement the next day.</p>

<p>Sherman was in command of the left wing,
while Thomas held the center, and Hooker the
right, and they had planned to sever communications
between Bragg and Longstreet, and thus
keep the Confederate army divided.</p>

<p>Early on the 24th Sherman moved against the
Confederate right, and with little opposition occupied
the northern end of Missionary Ridge.
The Confederates, after discovering this advantageous
position taken by Sherman, fought desperately
in the afternoon to regain it, but were
finally repulsed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
While this was going on, General Hooker, with
a division of Sherman's army, was making a
desperate struggle for the capture of Lookout
Mountain, whose rugged crests towered above the
clouds. This mountain was ably defended by
the Confederates, but they were finally pushed
back by overwhelming numbers and made their
final stand within the breastworks about the
Craven house, but were finally dislodged from
this place and retired within their entrenchments
in the valley.</p>

<p>This has been termed "The Battle in the
Clouds."</p>

<div id="ip_112" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><img src="images/i123.jpg" width="600" height="417" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG</div></div>

<p>On the morning of the 25th preparations were
made for the final battle on Missionary Ridge.
The attack was made by General Sherman, and
it seemed that the Confederates must recede from
the terrific onslaught, but they succeeded, after
a stubborn struggle, in repulsing the Federals at
this particular time, and they were pushed back
by General Hardy, who captured several hundred
prisoners. The Federals, quickly re-forming
their lines, renewed the assault and, after
waiting for Hooker to bring up his division,
Grant ordered a general advance, and the battle
was now on in earnest. Bragg opened on them
from the crest of Missionary Ridge with fifty
pieces of artillery and a line of musketry. Even
this did not stop the impetuous charge. The first
line of entrenchments of the Confederates was
carried with little opposition, and, as the Confederates
retired through other brigades, the confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
was great, and the retreat became almost
a rout.</p>

<p>Had it not been for a division of North Carolinan
soldiers under Major Weaver, who succeeded
in rallying his troops, and was successful
in holding the Federals in check, the retreat
would have become a rout of the entire Confederate
army.</p>

<p>This gave the Confederates a little time to
rally their lines, and they were able to retire from
the field in good order.</p>

<p>The battle was now over, and the field was left
in possession of the Federals, Bragg retiring with
his army into Georgia.</p>

<h2><a name="BATTLE_OF_THE_WILDERNESS" id="BATTLE_OF_THE_WILDERNESS">BATTLE OF THE WILDERNESS</a></h2>

<p>This was one of the great battles of modern
times, being second only to Gettysburg in our
Civil war. Napoleon never fought a battle on
the Continent of Europe that was equal to the
Wilderness. It was three times bloodier than
Austerlitz, after which battle it is said Napoleon's
triumphant march from Freize to Paris was more
grand than Queen Elizabeth's tour of England
after the defeat of the Spanish Armada.</p>

<p>The Battle of the Wilderness, together with
Spottsylvania, is thought to be more destructive
to the Federal forces than both Antietam and
Gettysburg combined.</p>

<p>On Lee's sudden departure from Gettysburg
there were many stragglers left behind, who were
taken prisoners by the Federals. Some of them
were not aware that the army had gone; others,
on account of slight wounds and sickness, were
not able to keep up with the army.</p>

<p>Lee succeeded in crossing the Potomac above
Harper's Ferry about the middle of July with
but little opposition from the Federals, and led
his army across the Rapidan, and there entrenched
himself to dispute the Federals under
General Meade, who had by this time succeeded
in crossing the Potomac and was moving upon
Culpeper Court House, at which place he concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
his forces. There was but little fighting
done during the remainder of the year, except
an unsuccessful cavalry expedition under Kilpatrick,
who sought to take Richmond by surprise.</p>

<p>During the early months of 1864 the authorities
at Washington became discouraged with General
Meade's management of the Army of the
Potomac. They thought that he should have
destroyed Lee's army on its retreat from Gettysburg;
while it is now conceded that Meade's management
was good, and that he did all that any
general could have done under the circumstances.
General Grant had come into great favor in the
North on account of his successive victories in the
West, and it was decided to give Grant command
of all the Federal forces, with the rank of lieutenant-general.
This high grade in command
had been held only by Generals Washington and
Scott, thus bringing together two great generals.
One the idol of the North: the other of the South.
Cæsar said he would rather be first man in a village
in Gaul than second in Rome.</p>

<p>Grant found under his command in the Army
of the Potomac 140,000 men.</p>

<p>Lee found under his command scarcely 60,000
men, but that spirit burned in the breast of his
soldiers notwithstanding their defeat at Gettysburg
and their loss of Vicksburg, that many hard
battles would be fought before the heel of the
invader should tread upon the streets of their
cherished capital, Richmond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Grant determined to move upon Richmond
and by doing so began with the Wilderness a
series of battles which are unequaled in history.</p>

<p>Grant's army was divided into three corps,
commanded by Hancock, Warren and Sedgwick.
Sheridan was in command of the cavalry. Burnside
was in command of another division of the
army, protecting the Orange and Alexandria
railroad.</p>

<p>Lee's army consisted of three corps of infantry,
commanded by Longstreet, Ewell and A.&nbsp;P. Hill,
and the cavalry by Stuart. A notable fact in
the organization of the Confederate army was
the few changes made in commanders.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of May 4th Grant's
army began crossing the Rapidan below Lee's
entrenchments. This being anticipated by Lee,
he at once prepared to set his own army in motion
and throw himself across the path of his foe.
Both armies were now near Chancellorsville, in
a wilderness country, where a great battle had
been fought the year before. This country was
covered by underbrush and ragged foliage, with
scrub pine, and dotted here and there with small
clearings. This wilderness country was pierced
by a few roads leading from the fords of the
river. The Federals had advanced up these
roads as far as the Wilderness Tavern, in which
General Grant established his headquarters.</p>

<p>This wilderness country was entered by two
roads from the southwest known as the "Old
Orange Turnpike" and the "Orange Plank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Road." Along these two roads the Confederates
moved their army to meet the advancing hosts
of the Federals, General Ewell leading his corps
along the turnpike and A.&nbsp;P. Hill along the plank
road. General Longstreet was hastening up
from Gordonsville, and it was very evident that
a great battle was near at hand.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 5th Ewell came in contact
with Warren's corps at a cross-road near
Parker's store, and this meeting precipitated the
beginning of the great battle.</p>

<p>About this time it became known to General
Grant that A.&nbsp;P. Hill was advancing by the plank
road, and he ordered Sedgwick to entrench and
prepare to receive the attack from A.&nbsp;P. Hill.
Hill came up very soon, and the battle began in
earnest. The musketry fire was continued with
great severity until late in the evening without
a decided advantage to either side. The loss
was great and the Federals had suffered the loss
of General Hays, who had been shot through the
head. The Confederates had suffered the loss of
General John M. Jones.</p>

<p>This ended the first day's struggle, and during
the night both armies entrenched themselves
directly in each other's front.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of May 6th the Federals
were reënforced by Burnside's corps, and A.&nbsp;P.
Hill by that of Longstreet.</p>

<p>General Grant issued orders for a general attack
all along the line, and soon the battle was
raging along the five-mile front, which became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
hand-to-hand contest. Artillery played but little
force in this battle, on account of the dense
growth of timber and underbrush, and it was
chiefly a battle of musketry.</p>

<p>The branches were cut from the trees by the
leaden missiles, and saplings were mowed down
as grass by a scythe.</p>

<p>The Confederates were finally driven back and
seemed on the verge of a panic. At this moment
General Lee rode through the lines to the front
and called on his soldiers to follow him. This
instantly gave courage to his army, which rallied
and began to push the Federals back. General
Lee was called back by his own men: "General
Lee to the rear! General Lee to the rear!"
This brave act on the part of General Lee, and
the arrival of Longstreet, restored order and
courage in the ranks, and they soon regained
their lost position.</p>

<p>General Longstreet, while riding with Generals
Kershaw and Jenkins, at the head of Jenkins'
brigade, were mistaken for the enemy by
their own men and fired on, and when the smoke
lifted Longstreet and Jenkins were down&mdash;Longstreet
seriously wounded, and Jenkins killed outright.
This was a serious loss to the Confederacy,
as they had suffered the loss of one general
and had incapacitated another from service.
A similar thing had occurred a year before at
Chancellorsville when General Jackson was mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>The fighting continued the rest of the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the advantage being first with one side and then
the other.</p>

<p>Darkness ended the two days' undecisive Battle
of the Wilderness, one of the greatest struggles
in history.</p>

<p>It was Grant's first measure of arms with General
Lee. While Grant had been defeated in his
plan to pass around Lee to Richmond, yet he had
made a new record for the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>The loss of the Federals in killed and wounded
was about 17,000, while that of the Confederates
was about 12,000.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_SPOTTSYLVANIA_COURT_HOUSE" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_SPOTTSYLVANIA_COURT_HOUSE">THE BATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE</a></h2>

<p>General John B. Gordon said that Spottsylvania
furnished the longest roll of incessant musketry;
the most splendid exhibition of heroism
and personal daring by large numbers who,
standing in the freshly spilled blood of their
comrades, faced for so long a period and at so
short a range the flaming rifles as they heralded
the decrees of death during the entire war. Such
examples of heroism, shown by both armies in that
hand-to-hand struggle at Spottsylvania Court
House, will not be lost to the Republic.</p>

<p>After the undecisive Battle of the Wilderness,
Grant again tried to get his army between that
of Lee and Richmond, and on the afternoon of
May 7th began to move his army in the direction
of Spottsylvania Court House. Lee had anticipated
this movement on the part of Grant, and
began at once to devise plans to throw his army
across the path of his adversary. He therefore
ordered General Anderson, who was now in command
of Longstreet's corps, Longstreet having
been wounded in the Battle of the Wilderness, to
march by a shorter route to Spottsylvania Court
House, hoping to reach the same before it was
occupied by the troops of Grant. This movement
was begun by Anderson on the night of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
May 7th. General Ewell was ordered to follow
up Anderson's corps. This he did by taking a
longer and more indirect route. When the Federals,
under Warren, reached Todd's Tavern
they found their cavalry in terrible conflict with
Fitzhugh Lee's division of the Confederate cavalry.
Fitzhugh Lee was reënforced by the advance
division of Anderson's corps, which by this
time had come up. General Warren was finally
repulsed and fell back, thus giving the Confederates
possession of Spottsylvania Court House
which was gained only by the timely arrival of
Anderson's corps.</p>

<p>The Federals tried again and again throughout
the day to break the Confederate lines, but
were repulsed in every attack. Thus Lee had
again blocked the path of Grant.</p>

<p>Both armies began to entrench themselves, as
it was very evident that a great battle was near
at hand. The Confederates formed their entrenchments
in the shape of a huge V, forming
a salient angle against the center of the Federal
line. This particular place has since been known
as the "Bloody Angle." The Confederate left
was commanded by Anderson, the center by
Ewell, the right by Early, who was temporarily
in command of A.&nbsp;P. Hill's corps, on account of
Hill's sickness. The Federal left was commanded
by Burnside, the center by Sedgwick
and Warren, and the right by Hancock.</p>

<p>May 9th was spent by both armies in getting
position and by some fighting between the outlying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
divisions of the armies. In one of these
skirmishes General Sedgwick was killed by a
sharpshooter's ball. He was succeeded in command
by H.&nbsp;G. Wright. His death was a great
loss to the Federal forces.</p>

<p>On the next day General Grant ordered a general
attack on the Confederate line. This attack
was led by General Warren, whose progress
was very slow owing to the dense thickets of low
cedar and the walls of abatis, which were thrown
in their way by the Confederates. This advance
of General Warren was met by a heavy artillery
and musket fire from Longstreet's corps, under
command of Anderson. Warren's troops came on
notwithstanding the heavy fire from all sides.
Some of his soldiers even crossed over the breastworks
and were either killed or taken prisoners
by the Confederates. The Federals finally retreated
with heavy loss.</p>

<p>Grant now thought it best to attack the Confederate
lines in front of Wright's corps. This
was done late in the evening by several divisions
under Upton. He advanced quickly through a
terrible fire and gained the entrenchments, where
they had a terrible hand-to-hand conflict with
bayonets fixed. The Confederates were overpowered
by numbers and gave way and fell back to
their second line of entrenchments. For this
brave act, Upton was made a brigadier-general.
The Confederates, however, were reënforced, and
Upton retired from the position which he had
gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
The battle was yet indecisive and both armies
had suffered great loss. Owing to the heavy
rains, the armies lay inactive on the 11th. It
was during this battle that Grant sent a message
to Washington saying that he would fight it out
on this line if it took all summer.</p>

<p>Grant, in the meantime, had sent General Sheridan
with his cavalry to threaten Richmond.</p>

<p>He was closely followed by General Stuart,
and on May 11th they fought a hard battle at
Yellow Tavern, in which General Stuart was
killed. His death was a severe loss to the Confederacy.
His experience as a cavalry leader,
obtained on many battlefields, was such that his
place could not be filled. A large statue has been
erected to his memory in the Hollywood cemetery
at Richmond, on which is recorded his feats
of valor on many fields.</p>

<p>Grant decided on another attack on the Confederate
lines at Spottsylvania on May 12th, the
objective point being the sharp angle in Lee's
entrenchments. This had been anticipated by
General Lee, and he had been making ready.
This attack was made at daybreak by General
Hancock's corps. It was the most severe and the
most bloody hand-to-hand conflict of the entire
battle. The attack was received by General
Johnston's brigade of Ewell's corps, which was
finally overpowered and captured. This was
the "Old Stonewall Brigade." This was a
serious loss to Lee's army.</p>

<p>The Federals pushed on to the Confederates'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
second entrenchments, but were here repulsed by
fresh troops under General Gordon. General Lee
himself rode up with Gordon, but was forced
back again by the cry of his own men: "General
Lee to the rear!"</p>

<p>The fighting was kept up all day along the
line. The trenches had to be cleared frequently
of the dead to give room for the living. The
slaughter continued until late in the night and
was undecisive. The Confederates finally fell
back within their entrenchments.</p>

<p>General Grant was deeply moved by the terrible
loss of life at the "Bloody Angle."</p>

<p>The total loss to the Federals exceeded 18,000;
the Confederates, about 9,000. Grant found
that no ordinary methods of war would overcome
the Army of Northern Virginia, and that
his only hope was in the long drawn-out campaign
with larger numbers. For the next five
days short battles were fought at intervals between
the outlying divisions of the armies.</p>

<p>Grant's army still moved to the southeast, with
Lee following close along in their front, always
ready to dispute any move that the Army of the
Potomac should make toward Richmond.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_COLD_HARBOR" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_COLD_HARBOR">THE BATTLE OF COLD HARBOR</a></h2>

<p>With this battle terminated the Wilderness
campaign, and was one over which Grant expressed
regret, and said that Cold Harbor was
the only battle that he ever fought that he would
not fight over again, and he always regretted that
the last assault at Cold Harbor was made.</p>

<p>The Federal commander had failed in his plan
to pass around Lee to Richmond, and now saw
that he must cross the James River and make
Petersburg his objective point.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of May 26, 1864, Grant
set his army in motion toward Cold Harbor. The
next day Lee moved his army by a shorter route
over the telegraph road to the Virginia Central
railroad. The two armies were stretched across
this low country parallel to each other and at
times they came in contact.</p>

<p>On the 31st day of May, General Sheridan
reached Cold Harbor. He had orders from
Meade that he should hold this place at all
hazards until the main army should arrive. Both
armies had received reënforcements. The Confederates
were reënforced by Breckinridge from
western Virginia, and by Pickett from North
Carolina. The Federals were reënforced from
the army of General Butler from down the James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
River. Thus Grant's army was brought up to
more than 100,000 men, and Lee's to about 75,000.</p>

<p>On May 31st Sheridan fought a severe battle
with Fitzhugh Lee at Cold Harbor, but it was
undecisive. On the next morning the Federal
army arrived on the field and immediately took
position. They were confronted by Longstreet's
corps and that of A.&nbsp;P. Hill, and the divisions of
Hoke and Breckinridge. Late in the evening
the Federals made a fierce attack on the Confederate
position and the Confederate lines were
broken in many places, but before night they
had succeeded in regaining some of their position.</p>

<p>It was well known to both armies that this
battle would decide Grant's last chance to get
between Lee and Richmond, and preparations
were made the next day for a decisive battle on
the morrow. The Federals were reënforced during
the night of June 2d by Hancock's and Burnside's
corps. The Confederates, being on the
defensive, had orders from General Lee to rest
on their arms and be ready to receive a fierce
assault which he was anticipating from the
Federals. It goes without saying that the Confederate
soldiers under such orders on this particular
night, and on account of the apparent
danger of their position, did not close their eyes
in sleep. The Federals were faced by Ewell's,
A.&nbsp;P. Hill's and Longstreet's corps, the latter
being under the command of Anderson, as Longstreet
was severely wounded in the Battle of the
Wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Both armies lay very close to each other, and
Lee's position was exceptionally strong, as it
must be approached through swampy ground,
and his batteries were set in position to give both
a front and an enfilading fire. Yet Grant determined
to make a general attack on the Confederate
lines, and passed word to his corps commanders
to make ready to execute the same at
about five o'clock on the morning of June 3d.</p>

<p>This order was carried out, and they had marshaled
their soldiers in large numbers into lines
ten columns deep, and at the appointed hour
began with a determined step to move toward
the Confederate entrenchments. The silence of
the early morning was broken by the Confederate
batteries and their musketry that raked
the open country over which the Federals were
advancing, which made the same appear as a
fiery furnace. The columns of blue were swept
by this fierce fire, which mowed them down in
great numbers. They succeeded in crossing into
the Confederate entrenchments in a few places
and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, but the
Confederates had orders to hold their position
at all hazards, and the Federal leaders soon
found it was impossible to stand the raking fire
from the Confederate batteries and ordered a
retreat, and in doing so they took with them a
few hundred prisoners. Thus the field was left
in the possession of the Confederates.</p>

<p>This battle is said to have lasted but twenty
minutes, and during this short time Grant lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
10,000 men. This is said to be the greatest loss
in the shortest time during the entire war.</p>

<p>With this battle ended the series of battles beginning
with that of the Wilderness, all having
been fought within a month, and nothing like
it has yet been known to warfare.</p>

<p>Grant's entire loss in all these engagements in
killed, wounded and missing was about 55,000
men, and that of the Confederates much less. If
Lee's loss had been equal to that of Grant's, his
army would have been almost annihilated.</p>

<p>The soldiers, either living or dead, who stood
in the dense columns of blue and marched across
that shell swept field toward the Confederate
entrenchments, and those who stood in the Confederate
ranks and successfully repulsed that
awful onslaught of the Federals on that bright
June morning at Cold Harbor, for these reasons
are possessed of a rich heritage which their
posterity should be proud to receive.</p>

<h2><a name="SHERMANS_MARCH_TO_THE_SEA" id="SHERMANS_MARCH_TO_THE_SEA">SHERMAN'S MARCH TO THE SEA</a></h2>

<p>General Sherman was given command of the
Western army, which was to operate against
Joseph E. Johnston, who was in command of
the Confederate army in the West. Johnston
was reckoned second to Lee in military genius.
Sherman found under his command 120,000 men,
while that of Johnston's army numbered about
75,000. The Federals were concentrated around
Chattanooga, while the Confederates were massed
at Dalton, where they had been in winter
quarters.</p>

<p>Sherman moved his army on May 6, 1864,
against Johnston, and thus the beginning of
Sherman's march to the sea and a series of battles
fought, viz.: Resaca, Kenesaw Mountain,
Peach Tree Creek and the Battle of Atlanta.</p>

<p>Sherman's army was divided into three divisions
commanded by Generals McPherson, Schofield
and Thomas. His army was in good spirits
and seemed anxious for the opportunity to move
forward, after a long wearisome winter in camp,
and rejoiced at the journey before them, though
their mission was to be one of strife and bloodshed.</p>

<p>General Johnston had succeeded General Bragg
in command of this Confederate army, which was
now divided into two corps, commanded by Generals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Hood and Hardee. He was later reënforced
by General Polk.</p>

<p>On account of the strong position occupied by
Johnston at Dalton Sherman thought best to
refrain from attacking him there and moved
round to the right of the Confederate army to
Resaca.</p>

<p>When Johnston discovered this movement on
the part of the Federals he quickly evacuated
Dalton and moved with all speed to Resaca, which
place he succeeded in reaching before it was occupied
by the Federals. On his way to Resaca
his cavalry, under General Wheeler, fought a
desperate battle with that of the Federals, under
General McCook, in which Wheeler was successful.</p>

<p>The Confederates were strongly entrenched at
Resaca by the time Sherman's army came up.</p>

<p>On May 14th Sherman ordered a general attack
on the Confederate stronghold, which was
done by Thomas' division and a part of Schofield's.
This attack was received by Hood's
corps. There was desperate fighting and the
advantage first lay with one and then the other,
when at length the Federals were reënforced by
General Hooker, and the Confederates fell back
to the second line of their entrenchments.</p>

<p>There was terrible fighting on the next day
during which the outworks were captured by
General Butterfield, but he was unable to hold
his position gained on account of the raking fire
from Hardee's corps, which galled him very
much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
During the night Johnston withdrew his army
from Resaca toward Atlanta, and was closely
followed by Sherman, who sent a part of his
army under General Davis to capture Rome, a
small town in Georgia, where there was quite a
number of iron factories.</p>

<p>This he did, and destroyed the factories, which
were a serious loss to the Confederates, for they
were used for the manufacture of cannon and
other munitions of war.</p>

<p>Johnston brought his army to a halt at Adairsville,
at which place he had fully decided to give
battle to Sherman, and had so informed his officers.
After skirmishing with the enemy for
some time he suddenly changed his mind and
withdrew his army to Cassville, where he took
a strong position and issued a spirited address
to his army, and had fully decided to give battle
to Sherman, but, on account of his superior
numbers, Sherman had been able to turn the
right flank of the Confederate army.</p>

<p>On the advice of Hood and Polk, Johnston
again withdrew his army from its position and
took a much stronger position a few miles south
on Kenesaw Mountain.</p>

<p>On account of these several retreats, gave rise
to a cause of a great deal of dissent among his
soldiers, as well as the inhabitants of the country
through which he passed, which left them
in the hands of the enemy, but it is conceded
that Johnston did the best he could, as his army
was inferior to that of Sherman both in numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
and equipment, and he was waiting for an opportunity
to catch Sherman's army divided, or to
get a strong position which would help him in
repulsing any attack made by Sherman. This
strong position he found at Kenesaw Mountain,
and here made ready for battle in earnest.</p>

<p>A few days prior to this, while Johnston's
army was retiring from its former position at
Cassville, they became engaged with a division
of the Federal army at Pine Mountain, in which
battle General Polk was killed by a cannon ball.
This was a serious loss to the Confederacy. He
was a graduate of West Point; but after being
graduated he took work with the Episcopal
church as bishop, but at the outbreak of the war
he entered the Confederate army and served
with distinction. Only a short time before his
death it is reported that he administered the
ordinance of baptism to Generals Johnston and
Hood. It is said that he was rebuked by some
of his church for taking up arms. He replied
that he felt as a man plowing in a field and was
called by his neighbor to help extinguish the
flames from his house which was on fire, and
after the fire would go back to work. He was succeeded
in command by General Loring.</p>

<p>Sherman decided to attack Johnston at Kenesaw
Mountain, this being anticipated by Johnston
and, on account of his strong position, met
with his approval. This desperate battle was
fought on the 27th day of June. Sherman's
army advanced against the strong Confederate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
works again and again during the day, but every
charge was repulsed, the mountainside being
swept by the musketry and artillery of the Confederates.
Sherman's loss in this battle was
more than 3,000 men, while that of the Confederates
was less than 1,000.</p>

<p>Sherman was convinced that his success did
not lay in attacking his antagonist in a strong
position, and turned upon Johnston's right and
attempted to pass around him to Atlanta in the
same manner in which Grant was trying to pass
around Lee to Richmond.</p>

<p>Sherman succeeded in drawing Johnston away
from Kenesaw Mountain, and Johnston withdrew
his army by shorter roads within the entrenchments
before Atlanta, which was immediately
confronted by the Federal hosts. This
was a critical time for Sherman, as the North
was in a presidential campaign in which it appeared
that the success of the war party depended
upon his capture of Atlanta; and on the
other hand it was a critical time for the Confederates,
for the loss of Atlanta would mean
the loss of their iron foundries, where they manufactured
most of their munitions of war, and
besides would divide their country in two divisions
again as Grant's capture of Vicksburg had
divided it before.</p>

<p>General Johnston was removed from command
of the army for the reasons assigned by the Confederate
government that he had failed to arrest
the advance of the enemy to the vicinity of Atlanta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
and that he had expressed no confidence
that he could defeat or repel Sherman, and for
these reasons he was relieved and the same was
handed to General Hood. It was said that when
General Johnston received this information he
informed General Hardee, who was with him, of
the information received. Hardee replied, "I
don't believe it." In answer Johnston said, "A
thing may be unbelievable and a fact."</p>

<p>The removal of Johnston from the command
is thought to have been a great mistake on the
part of the Confederate Government, as his tactics
had been in this campaign on the defensive
on account of his inferior numbers and equipment
to that of Sherman, while that of Hood was
on the aggressive, and he maintained the idea of
attacking Sherman's army, which proved to be
the loss of Atlanta for the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Hood found himself in command of about
60,000 men, and on July 20th offered battle
which was fierce and a decided loss to the Confederates,
in which they were repulsed on every
hand, but not without hard fighting and much
loss to the Federals, for General Hood had the
reputation of being a fearless, aggressive commander.
This was known as the Battle of Peach
Tree Creek.</p>

<p>Two days later, on July 22d, the Battle of
Atlanta was fought, this being the greatest engagement
of the entire campaign.</p>

<p>The Federals had closed in upon Atlanta and
had succeeded in capturing some out entrenchments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
but on the 22d was a general engagement
of all the army, the attack being made by
Hood to recapture some of his lost positions.
In this engagement General McPherson was
killed, which was a great blow to the Union
army. General Logan succeeded to his command.</p>

<p>The Confederates achieved considerable success,
but the Federals were presently reënforced,
and Hood withdrew within the defenses of Atlanta.
Again on the 28th the Federals were
attacked by General Hardee and a fierce battle
was fought at Ezra Church, in which the Confederates
were defeated with heavy loss.</p>

<p>Sherman determined on besieging the city and
if possible destroy the line of supplies for Hood's
army. This he succeeded in doing late in August
by destroying the Macon and Western railroad.</p>

<p>Hood determined to attack the Federals and
sent General Hardee to make an attack near
Jonesboro, while he himself should attack Sherman's
right flank. These attacks failed, thus
necessitating the evacuation of Atlanta, which
he did on September 2d, after destroying all
the supplies he could not take with him.</p>

<p>Hood kept his army between that of Sherman's
and Andersonville, at which place there were confined
many thousands of Federal prisoners.
With the fall of Atlanta practically ended the
points of interest of Sherman's march to the sea.</p>

<p>The command of Hood's army was later given
back to General Joseph E. Johnston.</p>

<h2><a name="BATTLE_OF_CLOYD_MOUNTAIN" id="BATTLE_OF_CLOYD_MOUNTAIN">BATTLE OF CLOYD MOUNTAIN</a></h2>

<p>In the early spring of 1864 the command of
the Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley was
given to General Hunter, who made ready to
march upon Lynchburg, with the object of taking
possession of the city and to capture large
stores of provisions and munitions of war which
belonged to the Confederates and were stored
at Lynchburg. He also laid waste to the country
over which his army passed so as to render
the same of little value as a source for supplies
to the Confederacy.</p>

<p>A division of his army under General Crooks
fought a desperate battle on the 9th day of May,
1864, with the Confederates, commanded by
General Jenkins, at Cloyd's farm, near Dublin
depot, in southwestern Virginia. This was one
of the most severe short engagements of the entire
war, in which General Jenkins was killed
and the total loss to the Confederates in killed
and wounded and missing was about 900, and
that of the Federals somewhat less. During this
short engagement the grim monster Death was
on every side, and whose threatening shrieks
howled in the air around them.</p>

<p>Hunter's main army finally reached the vicinity
of Lynchburg on the 17th day of June,
after fighting a battle with Imboden and Mc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>Causland
a few miles away from Lynchburg,
the Confederates falling back within the breastworks
which they had hastily thrown up. The
city was defended by a portion of Breckinridge's
division, but their numbers were far inferior to
that of the Federals, who had by this time arrived
before the city. Hunter halted his army
and brought up his artillery and did some cannonading,
but went into camp with the expectation
of taking the city without much opposition
the next morning. It is thought that he could
have easily taken the city on the evening of his
arrival, but during the night General Gordon
arrived with his division and the Confederates
were reënforced by other arrivals next morning
from the army of General Early, then on its way
to the Shenandoah Valley. On the morning of
the 18th General Hunter found Lynchburg full
of Confederate soldiers, and more arriving on
every train, which on the arrival the bands
playing could plainly be heard by the Federal
soldiers as they came upon the field. Hunter
soon found, in his opinion, the capture of Lynchburg
an impossibility, and his raid was to terminate
in a dismal failure. During the 18th
there was some cannonading and several skirmishes
between the cavalry of the two contending
armies.</p>

<p>On the night of the 19th he broke camp and
marched away to the westward. Why he retreated
without giving battle was not understood.
General Gordon said that in his opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
that conscience was harrowing General Hunter
and causing him to see an avenger wrapped in
every gray jacket before him. The Confederates
took up the pursuit of Hunter's retreating
army, but Hunter succeeded in getting back
across the mountains into western Virginia, after
hard marches over mountain roads with little
or no supplies for his army, and with a large
amount of straggling.</p>

<p>General Lee dispatched General Early with
an army of 20,000 men to threaten Washington,
in the hope of drawing part of Grant's army
away from before Richmond. Early was to go
by the way of Shenandoah Valley. This route
was given him partly in order to help defend
Lynchburg and to get supplies for his army in
the valley. He reached Winchester on the 3d
of July, and moved rapidly down the valley and
crossed into Maryland, and was at Hagerstown
on the 6th. He turned about and moved boldly
upon Washington. He met and defeated General
Wallace on the Monocacy on July 9th, and
on the next day he was within six miles of the
capitol at Washington. An immediate assault
might have given him possession of the city,
which was weakly defended, but he delayed for
a day, and in the meantime two divisions under
General Wright from Grant's army from before
Petersburg arrived and Early was forced to
retreat, after spending the 12th in threatening
the city. This was considered one of the boldest
raids of the entire war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
This attack on Washington by General Early
created considerable excitement in the city, for
no other Confederate army had ever been so
near to the capital before. The government employees
of all kinds, the sailors from the navy
yard, and the convalescents from the hospitals,
were all rushed out to the forts around the city.
Even President Lincoln himself went out to the
defenses of the city.</p>

<p>Early recrossed the Potomac at Snickers'
Ferry on the 18th. Here he was overtaken by
the pursuing Federals, at which place a battle
was fought in which Early was the victor. He
fought another battle at Winchester with General
Averell's cavalry.</p>

<p>Grant decided to give the command of the
army in the Shenandoah to General Philip H.
Sheridan, to whom he gave instructions to drive
the Confederates out of the valley once for all,
and to destroy all growing crops and everything
that would be of any advantage to the Confederacy
in the way of supplies for their army or
otherwise. This he finally did, and Sheridan
afterwards said that he believed a crow could
fly over the entire valley without getting even
a mouthful to eat.</p>

<p>September found the two armies near Winchester,
and on the 19th a severe battle was
fought which was kept up the entire day, the
advantage being first with one side and then the
other. Finally the Confederates, being outnumbered,
retreated back through Winchester. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
was a bloody day, in which the loss of the Federals
was about 5,000, and that of the Confederates
about 4,000.</p>

<p>The next day the Confederates were overtaken
at Fisher's Hill, at which place Early was making
preparations for a great battle, which engagement
did not occur until the 22d. This engagement
proved to be disastrous to Early, his
army being flanked by the Federals with superior
numbers. He began a stubborn retreat,
which finally became a rout. He was closely
followed up by the Federals, and fought several
small engagements on his retreat.</p>

<p>On about the middle of October he received
reënforcements from Longstreet, and on the 19th
he attacked Sheridan's army at Cedar Creek,
under the immediate command of General
Wright, Sheridan having gone to Washington,
but returned in time to take part in the battle.
This took place about twenty miles from Winchester,
the attack being made by General Gordon,
who fell upon General Sheridan's men
while they were yet sleeping early in the morning.
Gordon was immediately supported by the
army; Early himself came up to the attack. The
Federals were completely surprised and retreated,
which became a rout, leaving their entire
camp equipment, together with some prisoners,
in the hands of the Confederates. The
Confederates thought they had gained a signal
victory, and gave up the pursuit of the retreating
Federals, and turned their attention to pillaging
the Federal camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
General Sheridan was on his way from Winchester
to his army headquarters at Cedar Creek
when he heard the roar of the cannon which convinced
him that a great battle was being fought.
He at once made haste to take charge of his
army, this being Sheridan's famous ride. He
first met stragglers of his army, and then passed
through brigade after brigade of his retreating
army, which so blocked the highway that he was
compelled to leave the same and take to the
fields. He at length succeeded in stopping the
retreat and turned it into an attacking column.
In this retreat were two divisions commanded by
two future presidents, viz.: President Hayes and
McKinley. This attack on the Confederates
completely surprised them, and they were utterly
routed and so badly defeated that Early's army
was never completely reorganized, this being the
last principal engagement in the Shenandoah
Valley.</p>

<p>Previous to these battles in the valley, Early
had dispatched General McCausland with his
division of cavalry to go into Pennsylvania to
levy large sums of money on the towns in reprisal
for Hunter's depredations in the Shenandoah
Valley. This cavalry party burned the
town of Chambersburg.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SIEGE_AND_FALL_OF_PETERSBURG" id="THE_SIEGE_AND_FALL_OF_PETERSBURG">THE SIEGE AND FALL OF PETERSBURG</a></h2>

<p>After the battle of Cold Harbor Grant remained
a few days trying to find a weak place
in the Confederate lines. This he abandoned
and resolved to move his army across the James
and to Petersburg, which place is about twenty
miles from Richmond, and was defended by
General Beauregard with a small division of the
Confederate army.</p>

<p>Petersburg was at the junction of three railroads,
and was a place of great importance to
the Confederacy, as all the supplies of Lee's
army, as well as to Richmond, came by the way
of Petersburg, and for these reasons General
Grant resolved to destroy the railroads, and if
possible to capture the city, and thus destroy the
Confederates' source of supplies.</p>

<p>These conditions being well known to Lee, he
resolved to defend Petersburg, and to save it
from capture if possible, and thus began the
greatest struggle of its kind known in modern
times.</p>

<p>The advance divisions of Grant's army, under
Hancock and W.&nbsp;F. Smith, appeared before
Petersburg June 15, 1864. Beauregard managed
to hold the entrenchments with his small
force until Lee's main army arrived, which came
by a shorter route than the one which the Federals
had taken. Both armies were in full force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
before Petersburg by the evening of the 18th,
and the great struggle had now begun. The
Confederate entrenchments extended for thirty
miles, and the whole country was a network of
fortifications. Grant at once began to extend his
lines of entrenchments, and thus the two armies
were pitted against each other for their last
great struggle, the army of General Grant numbering
more than 100,000 men, while that of
General Lee was about half that number.</p>

<p>General Grant turned his attention to trying
to destroy the railroads, and made several attempts
with much hard fighting to do so. But
this, having been anticipated by General Lee,
he had given to A.&nbsp;P. Hill the defense and the
protection of the railroads, which was his source
of supplies. They were ably protected by General
Hill, and Grant's attacking parties in every
instance were repulsed, and these plans were at
length abandoned by him for the present.</p>

<p>The two armies lay facing each other before
Petersburg the entire summer and fall, with
several small engagements during the summer
and a few very severe ones.</p>

<p>A severe cavalry engagement was fought
at Trevilian Station, north of Richmond, on
June 11th, between the Confederates, commanded
by Generals Hampton and Fitzhugh
Lee, and the Federals, commanded by General
Sheridan.</p>

<p>During the latter days of July the Federals
were engaged in digging a mammoth tunnel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
beginning in the rear of their entrenchments
and to extend under the Confederate fortifications
before Petersburg, at the completion of
which they expected to fill the same with large
quantities of gunpowder which was to be exploded
and was expected to blow up the Confederate
fortifications.</p>

<p>Of all the schemes employed by either army
this was the greatest, and one in which Grant
had great faith, and the progress of which was
watched with great anxiety. The Confederates
were apprised of this undertaking, and had
made ready by placing several batteries within
their lines so that the fire from the same would
sweep the opening which would be made by the
blowing up of the "crater." At a few minutes
past five on the morning of July 30th this mine
was exploded, which was a sight to behold. The
Federal troops who were in waiting to march
through the opening were somewhat delayed
from the shock and horror of the explosion, but
at length marched in the opening in great numbers,
and by this time the Confederate batteries
were brought into action, which so horribly
swept their ranks, and they were charged by
General Mahone with several divisions of Georgia
troops, and the Federal loss became so great, and
their ranks in so much confusion, that they were
ordered to retire within their entrenchments,
thus bringing to a dismal failure the capture of
Petersburg by this plan.</p>

<p>During the last days of August Grant renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
his plan to destroy the Weldon railroad.
This task was given to General Warren, with a
large force who, after fighting several hard battles
with the dashing Mahone, whose numbers
were greatly inferior to that of Warren, and
from his reputation for strategy it is thought
that he was very worthy to wear the mantle of
"Stonewall" Jackson, the Federals succeeded in
destroying this railroad in several places.</p>

<p>Grant continued to extend his lines, and by
the end of October he was very near the Southside
railroad, and on the 27th fought a desperate
battle with A.&nbsp;P. Hill at Hatcher's Run, in which
the Federals were defeated and retired within
their entrenchments before Petersburg, this being
the last engagement of importance until the
coming spring.</p>

<p>The suffering and privation endured by Lee's
army during the winter of 1864 and 1865, while
they lay within the defenses of Petersburg and
Richmond with scant clothing and food, can
scarcely be imagined by anyone excepting those
who were there. Their numbers were depleted
by sickness and other causes so by the coming of
spring Lee had within his ranks less than 50,000
men.</p>

<p>Lee's lines had been extended until they were
so thin that there was danger of breaking. A.&nbsp;P.
Hill held the right, Gordon and Anderson the
center, and Longstreet the left. Late in February
Grant's army was reënforced by General
Sheridan from the valley, and in the last days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of March it was further reënforced from General
Butler's army from down the James River.</p>

<p>General Lee began to see the position that he
was in with his army against superior numbers
and equipment, and felt that he must sooner or
later evacuate Petersburg, and began to plan a
junction of his army with General Johnston's
in North Carolina.</p>

<p>General Grant anticipated this plan of Lee's
and began to extend his lines westward so if
possible to cut off Lee's chances of retreat.</p>

<p>Lee determined to make a bold attack on
Grant's right, the objective point being Fort
Stedman. This plan was given to General
Gordon to be carried out, which he gallantly did,
and captured the fort, but was unable to hold
the same, and retired within the Confederate
lines. His attack and capture of Fort Stedman
was carefully planned and well supported by the
main Confederate army.</p>

<p>The battle at Fort Stedman did not interfere
with Grant's plan in extending his lines along
the front of the Confederate army, under General
Warren. Lee had sent General Anderson to
hold the road over which he would retreat in the
event he was compelled to evacuate Petersburg.</p>

<p>On the 31st a large Confederate force was at
Dinwiddie Court House, and during that night
they took a strong position at Five Forks, and
here on April 1st a hard battle was fought, the
Federals being commanded by Generals Sheridan
and Warren. The Confederates were finally
defeated with a loss of 5,000 prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
The Confederates' defeat at Five Forks was a
great blow to Lee, and he immediately began
preparations for the evacuation of Petersburg
and Richmond.</p>

<p>On the night of April 1st Grant began his
attack all along his lines, which he kept up the
entire night. His cannon threw shells into the
doomed city, and at dawn on April 2d the assault
began. The Federal troops went forward
in an impetuous charge through a storm of grape
and canister which was poured into their ranks.
The Confederates fell back within their inner
breastworks and the Federals pushed on the left
as far as Hatcher's Run, where they had a severe
engagement in which the Confederate General
Pegram was killed, and another engagement near
the Southside railroad in which General A.&nbsp;P.
Hill was killed. His death was an irreparable
loss to the Confederacy. He was one of their
able corps commanders, and had been in all the
principal engagements in the East. He played a
distinctive part in the Seven Days' Battles before
Richmond; his timely arrival on the field
saved Lee's army from utter rout at Antietam
Creek and turned defeat into partial victory;
he was a great favorite of "Stonewall" Jackson,
and took a distinctive part in the battles of
Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, in which
last-named battle he was near by when "Stonewall"
Jackson was mortally wounded; with his
corps was first on the field at Gettysburg; his
corps received the first onslaught of the Federals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
at the Battle of the Wilderness; was too sick to
command his corps at Spottsylvania Court House,
which was temporarily commanded by General
Early; played a distinctive part at Cold Harbor,
and here at Petersburg, on Sunday, April 2d, the
end. He was buried in the cemetery at Petersburg
on the night of April 2d, while the whole
country was being lit up by bursting shells and
the hurrying and noise of the progress of a great
battle.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, April 2d, General Lee
notified the authorities at Richmond that he must
evacuate Petersburg at once, and to notify President
Davis of the situation. President Davis
was at St. Paul's Church with several of his
cabinet listening to a sermon by Dr. Minnegerode,
speaking of a supper before Gethsemane.
The sexton walked up the isle and handed the
President the message, which he read, and quietly
retired from the church, this being noticeable on
account of it being somewhat out of the ordinary,
although they were accustomed to the roar of the
cannon at Petersburg. However, it was soon
known that Petersburg and Richmond were soon
to be evacuated, and the service was dismissed
at the church without further announcement.</p>

<p>The city of Richmond was in a state of excitement
as the officers of the government departed
from the city on their way to Danville, and during
the night the arsenals were set on fire by the
evacuating troops. The flames spread to a large
portion of the city, which was burned. The next
day the city was taken charge of by the Federals.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SURRENDER_AT_APPOMATTOX" id="THE_SURRENDER_AT_APPOMATTOX">THE SURRENDER AT APPOMATTOX</a></h2>

<p>We are now to the closing scenes of the greatest
civil war of modern times.</p>

<p>Lee evacuated Petersburg early on the third
morning of April, 1865, and retreated toward
Amelia Court House.</p>

<p>With the evacuation of Petersburg also fell
the city of Richmond. For nine months Lee's
invincible forces had kept a foe more than twice
their numbers from invading their capital.</p>

<p>Lee had ordered supplies for his army to
Amelia Court House, for which they were in sore
need, as they had been on little or no rations for
several days, but by some mistake of orders the
train of supplies had been sent on to Richmond.
This serious mistake was a crushing blow to Lee's
army, for when his troops reached Amelia Court
House and found no supplies, which had been
promised them, their hopes sank within them.
Lee, as well as his officers, had come to realize
that the end of the great war could not be far
distant.</p>

<p>Grant's army was hastening in pursuit of that
of Lee's, Grant had sent General Sheridan to
flank around Lee's army and get in his front, so
if possible to cut off his chance of escape.</p>

<p>Lee had intended to concentrate his forces at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Amelia Court House, but his whole army did not
come up until the evening of the 5th, and on the
discovery of his inadequate supplies he began the
march anew toward Farmville, dividing his army
so as to secure supplies from the country over
which he passed. In the afternoon of April 6th
Lee's army was overtaken by the Federals and a
hard battle was fought at Sailor's Creek, in
which General Richard Ewell, who was on the
rear of Lee's army, was captured with his entire
corps, numbering about 6,000 men.</p>

<p>Lee's main army reached Farmville on the
night of the 6th of April, where they received
their first rations within two days, and near which
place a hard battle was fought, in which the
Confederates, under General Mahone, gained a
temporary victory.</p>

<p>The retreat was again renewed in the hope of
breaking through the Federal lines, which were
rapidly enveloping around them. During these
marches the soldiers were so worn out from
hunger, fatigue, and lack of sufficient clothing
in the early spring weather, that there was much
straggling from the army, and many had thrown
their arms away until scarcely one-third of Lee's
army was equipped for battle.</p>

<p>Lee's army reached Appomattox Court House
late in the evening of April 8th, and here found
the Federals in their front, and were compelled
to stop and prepare for battle. General Lee and
his officers held a council of war that night and
decided to make a desperate effort to cut through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
the Federal lines the next morning. This task
was assigned to General Gordon.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 9th, Gordon made a fierce
attack upon the Federals in his front, but was
finally repulsed by overwhelming numbers, and
sent word to General Lee that he could do nothing
further unless he was heavily supported from
Longstreet's corps.</p>

<p>With the repulse of Gordon on that morning
sank Lee's last hope of breaking through the
Federal lines, and he said there is nothing to do
but see Grant.</p>

<p>Grant had proposed to Lee at Farmville, on
the evening of the 7th, terms for the surrender
of Lee's army, to which Lee replied that as much
as he desired peace, yet the time certainly had
not arrived for the surrender of the Army of
Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>After the repulse of Gordon, on April 9th,
Lee soon arranged a meeting with Grant and a
truce was ordered pending negotiations for the
surrender of Lee's army. This meeting took
place at the house of Wilmer McLean at Appomattox
Court House, at which place the terms
were finally agreed upon by the two world
famous commanders and were put in writing in
the form of a letter from General Grant to
General Lee, and the acceptance of the terms
were written by Lee to Grant in the same form.</p>

<p>It is interesting to know that Wilmer McLean
had lived on the battlefield of Bull Run during
the progress of the first battle fought there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
after the battle moved to Appomattox Court
House, and at his house was negotiated the terms
of the surrender of Lee's army, thus around his
premises was fought the first and the last great
battle of the war.</p>

<p>The Confederate officers were allowed to retain
their side arms, and the Confederate soldiers
to retain their horses. This was a welcome concession.</p>

<p>Lee's army numbered less than 28,000 men,
which he surrendered. Of these less than one-third
were bearing arms on the day of surrender.</p>

<p>The Confederate soldiers for some time did not
realize that negotiations for their surrender was
on and were expecting and seemed to be anxious
for another battle with General Sheridan in their
front, and were greatly surprised on learning of
the negotiations that had been completed for their
surrender.</p>

<p>It was at once apparent to all that the great
war was practically ended.</p>

<p>On the next day the surrender of the army was
completed, and when Lee made his farewell address
to his soldiers, who had so faithfully defended
their faith in the Confederacy in all the
hard battles in which they had been engaged, and
especially since the Wilderness campaign, and
in the defense of Petersburg and Richmond in
the closing days, where their endurance was
the greatest, and had now come down to the
closing scenes at Appomattox, they were all deeply
moved. General Lee, in broken accents, admonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
them to be as brave citizens as they had
been soldiers.</p>

<p>Thus practically ended the greatest civil war
in history. Soon after Lee's surrender the other
Confederate forces arranged for their surrender
in quick succession.</p>

<p>It had been a long, bloody and devastating
war, and it is said that there were more Confederate
prisoners at Point Lookout alone than
the number with Lee's army at the surrender.</p>

<p>The war closed on a spectacle of ruin the
greatest yet known in America. While the
smoke had cleared away, and the roar of the cannon
had ceased, yet there could be heard the
wailing of mothers, widows and orphans throughout
both North and South, which is the greatest
costs of so great and devastating war.</p>

<p>The Southern states lay prostrate; their resources
gone; their fields desolate; their cities
ruined; the fruits of the toil of generations all
swept to destruction.</p>

<p>The total number of Union soldiers engaged
were about a million and a half. Of this number,
275,000 were either killed in battle, died of
mortal wounds or from disease in camp, and the
loss to the Confederates was approximately the
same. In both armies about 400,000 were disabled
for life, thus making a grand total loss of
about a million able-bodied men to the country.</p>

<p>At the close of the war over 60,000 Confederate
prisoners were released. The records of the war
department shows that 220,000 Confederates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
were made prisoners in the war. This includes,
of course, the surrender of the armies at the
close. Of this number 25,000 died of wounds
and disease during their captivity. The estimated
number of Union captives were about
200,000, of whom 40,000 died in captivity.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
